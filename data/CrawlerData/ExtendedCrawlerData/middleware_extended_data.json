            "Abstract": "Cloud providers offer an array of storage services that represent different points along the performance, cost, and durability spectrum. If an application desires the composite benefits of multiple storage tiers, then it must manage the complexity of different interfaces to these storage services and their diverse policies. We believe that it is possible to provide the benefits of customized tiered cloud storage to applications without compromising simplicity using a lightweight middleware. In this paper, we introduce Tiera, a middleware that enables the provision of multi-tiered cloud storage instances that are easy to specify, flexible, and enable a rich array of storage policies and desired metrics to be realized. Tiera's novelty lies in the first-class support for encapsulated tiered cloud storage, ease of programmability of data management policies, and support for runtime replacement and addition of policies and tiers. Tiera enables an application to realize a desired metric (e.g., low latency or low cost) by selecting different storage services that constitute a Tiera instance, and easily specifying a policy, using event and response pairs, to manage the life cycle of data stored in the instance. We illustrate the benefits of Tiera through a prototype implemented on the Amazon cloud. By deploying unmodified MySQL database engine and a TPC-W Web bookstore application on Tiera, we are able to improve their respective throughputs by 47% -- 125% and 46% -- 69%, over standard deployments. We further show the flexibility of Tiera in achieving different desired application metrics with minimal overhead.",

            "Abstract": "A large family of distributed transactional protocols have a common structure, called Deferred Update Replication (DUR). DUR provides dependability by replicating data, and performance by not re-executing transactions but only applying their updates. Protocols of the DUR family differ only in behaviors of few generic functions. Based on this insight, we offer a generic DUR middleware, called G-DUR, along with a library of finely-optimized plug-in implementations of the required behaviors. This paper presents the middleware, the plugins, and an extensive experimental evaluation in a geo-replicated environment. Our empirical study shows that:(i) G-DUR allows developers to implement various transactional protocols under 600 lines of code; (ii) It provides a fair, apples-to-apples comparison between transactional protocols; (iii) By replacing plugs-ins, developers can use G-DUR to understand bottlenecks in their protocols; (iv) This in turn enables the improvement of existing protocols; and (v) Given a protocol, G-DUR helps evaluate the cost of ensuring various degrees of dependability.",

LVD transparently consolidates duplicate blocks across virtual machines to create a lean disk image, leading to a merged datapath for all virtual machines. This merged datapath allows efficient storage usage, reduction in disk I/O (read/write) by eliminating I/O for same content across VMs and efficient host cache utilization. LVD is motivated by clouds, where VMs are created from golden masters and use standardized middleware and management tools leading to high content similarity. We implement LVD as an extension of QCow2 and study its ability to improve common data center system management activities as well as improving application performance of popular I/O benchmark workloads. We observed that LVD reduced disk space and disk I/O by 70%, making applications run faster by 25% on an average.",

            "Abstract": "Adoption of hybrid clouds by enterprises has been hampered by the inability of current hybrid cloud infrastructures to provide scalable and efficient mechanisms (1) to ensure the trustworthiness and integrity of the software stack executing a hybrid application workload, or (2) to enforce governmental privacy, data jurisdiction and audit regulations by ensuring that remote data and computation do not cross specified geographic boundaries.\n This paper presents our vision of trustworthy geographically fenced hybrid clouds (TGHC), a generic, scalable and extensible middleware system to automatically bridge the gap between applications with their integrity and geo-fencing policies, and raw hardware infrastructure. It describes TGHCs modularly, by (a) outlining the challenges in certifying the trustworthiness of cloud computing infrastructures and in geo-fencing computation, including scalability limitations of existing solutions, (b) presenting scalable mechanisms to transform bare metal servers into trusted IaaS computing pools through integrity measurement, management and monitoring that leverage open, off-the-shelf hardware technologies like Intel TPM, (c) introducing workload specification languages to specify integrity and geo-fencing policies on hybrid workloads, and (d) extending IaaS systems to ensure that workload bursting from private data centers to public clouds uses trusted computing pools and respects geographic boundaries during initial placement of virtual machines (VMs) and further migration.\n We also present early results from our implementation illustrating the feasibility of our proposed architecture, and outline future research challenges in engineering and effectively using TGHCs.",

            "Abstract": "The design of elastic file synchronization services like Dropbox is an open and complex issue yet not unveiled by the major commercial providers, as it includes challenges like fine-grained programmable elasticity and efficient change notification to millions of devices. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for file synchronization which aims to solve the above two major challenges. At the heart of our proposal lies ObjectMQ, a lightweight framework for providing programmatic elasticity to distributed objects using messaging. The efficient use of indirect communication: i) enables programmatic elasticity based on queue message processing, ii) simplifies change notifications offering simple unicast and multicast primitives; and iii) provides transparent load balancing based on queues.\n Our reference implementation is StackSync, an open source elastic file synchronization Cloud service developed in the context of the FP7 project CloudSpaces. StackSync supports both predictive and reactive provisioning policies on top of ObjectMQ that adapt to real traces from the Ubuntu One service. The feasibility of our approach has been extensively validated with an open benchmark, including commercial synchronization services like Dropbox or OneDrive.",

            "Abstract": "Sliding window analytics is often used in distributed data-parallel computing for analyzing large streams of continuously arriving data. When pairs of consecutive windows overlap, there is a potential to update the output incrementally, more efficiently than recomputing from scratch. However, in most systems, realizing this potential requires programmers to explicitly manage the intermediate state for overlapping windows, and devise an application-specific algorithm to incrementally update the output.\n In this paper, we present self-adjusting contraction trees, a set of data structures and algorithms for transparently updating the output of a sliding window computation as the window moves, while reusing, to the extent possible, results from prior computations. Self-adjusting contraction trees structure sub-computations of a data-parallel computation in the form of a shallow (logarithmic depth) balanced data dependence graph, through which input changes are efficiently propagated in asymptotically sub-linear time.\n We implemented self-adjusting contraction trees in a system called Slider. The design of Slider incorporates several novel techniques, most notably: (i) a set of self balancing trees tuned for different variants of sliding window computation (append-only, fixed-width, or variable-width slides); (ii) a split processing mode, where a background pre-processing stage leverages the predictability of input changes to pave the way for a more efficient foreground processing when the window slides; and (iii) an extension of the data structures to handle multiple-job workflows such as data-flow query processing. We evaluated Slider using a variety of applications and real-world case studies. Our results show significant performance gains without requiring any changes to the existing application code used for non-incremental data processing.",

            "Abstract": "Top-k matching is a fundamental problem underlying on-line advertising platforms, mobile social networks, etc. Distributed processes (e.g., advertisers) specify predicates, which we call subscriptions, for events (e.g., user actions) they wish to react to. Subscriptions define weights for elementary constraints on individual event attributes and do not require that events match all constraints. An event is multicast only to the processes with the k highest match scores for that event -- this score is the aggregation of the weights of all constraints in a subscription matching the event.\n However, state-of-the-art approaches to top-k matching support only rigid models of events and subscriptions, which leads to suboptimal matches. We present a novel model of weighted top-k matching which is more expressive than the state-of-the-art, and a corresponding efficient algorithm. Our model supports attributes with intervals, weights specified by producers of events or by subscriptions, negative weights, prorating of matched constraints, and the ability to vary scores dynamically with system parameters. Our algorithm exhibits time and space complexities which are competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms regardless of our added expressiveness -- O(M log N + S log k) and O(M N + k) respectively, with N the number of constraints, M the number of event attributes, and S the number of matching constraints.\n Through empirical evaluation with both statistically generated and real-world data we demonstrate that our algorithm is (a) equally or more efficient and scalable than the state-of-the art without exploiting our added expressiveness, and it (b) significantly outperforms existing approaches upgraded -- if possible at all -- to match our expressiveness.",
            "TLDR": "This work presents a novel model of weighted top-k matching which is more expressive than the state-of-the-art, and a corresponding efficient algorithm which significantly outperforms existing approaches upgraded -- if possible at all -- to match the authors' expressiveness."

            "Abstract": "The ever-growing amount of data available on the Internet calls for personalization. Yet, the most effective personalization schemes, such as those based on collaborative filtering (CF), are notoriously resource greedy. This paper presents HyRec, an online cost-effective scalable system for user-based CF personalization. HyRec offloads recommendation tasks onto the web browsers of users, while a server orchestrates the process and manages the relationships between user profiles.\n HyRec has been fully implemented and extensively evaluated on several workloads from MovieLens and Digg. We convey the ability of HyRec to reduce the operation costs of content providers by nearly 50% and to provide a 100-fold improvement in scalability with respect to a centralized (or cloud-based recommender approach), while preserving the quality of personalization. We also show that HyRec is virtually transparent to users and induces only 3% of the bandwidth consumption of a P2P solution.",

            "Abstract": "The deployment of MapReduce in datacenters and clouds present several challenges in achieving good job performance. Compared to in-house dedicated clusters, datacenters and clouds often exhibit significant hardware and performance heterogeneity due to continuous server replacement and multi-tenant interferences. As most Mapreduce implementations assume homogeneous clusters, heterogeneity can cause significant load imbalance in task execution, leading to poor performance and low cluster utilizations. Despite existing optimizations on task scheduling and load balancing, MapReduce still performs poorly on heterogeneous clusters.\n In this paper, we find that the homogeneous configuration of tasks on heterogeneous nodes can be an important source of load imbalance and thus cause poor performance. Tasks should be customized with different settings to match the capabilities of heterogeneous nodes. To this end, we propose an adaptive task tuning approach, Ant, that automatically finds the optimal settings for individual tasks running on different nodes. Ant works best for large jobs with multiple rounds of map task execution. It first configures tasks with randomly selected configurations and gradually improves tasks settings by reproducing the settings from best performing tasks and discarding poor performing configurations. To accelerate task tuning and avoid trapping in local optimum, Ant uses genetic functions during task configuration. Experimental results on a heterogeneous cluster and a virtual cluster with varying hardware capabilities show that Ant improves the average job completion time by 23%, 11%, and 16% compared to stock Hadoop, customized Hadoop with industry recommendations, and a profiling-based configuration approach, respectively.",
            "TLDR": "An adaptive task tuning approach, Ant, that automatically finds the optimal settings for individual tasks running on different nodes and uses genetic functions during task configuration to accelerate task tuning and avoid trapping in local optimum is proposed."

            "Abstract": "Event-based systems follow a decoupled mode of interaction between event producers and consumers in space, time, and synchronization to enable scalability within distributed systems. We recognize a fourth dimension of coupling due to the need for mutual agreements on terms that describe event types, attributes, and values. Semantic coupling is challenging in large-scale, open, and heterogeneous environments such as the Internet of Things (IoT). It requires event producers and consumers to agree on event semantics and can limit scalability due to the difficulties in establishing such agreements. In this paper we propose a new thematic event processing approach based on enhancing events and subscriptions with terms representing their themes to clarify their domains and meanings in addition to their pay-load. Experiments conducted using large heterogeneous sets of smart-city and energy management events suggest up to 85% of matching accuracy at a rate of 500 events/sec of throughput. This represents around 15% improvement in accuracy and 150% in throughput over non-thematic approaches. This suggests the viability of thematic event processing to scale to environments such as the IoT.",

            "Abstract": "Current checkpointing techniques employed to overcome faults for HPC applications result in inferior application performance after restart from a checkpoint for a number of applications. This is due to a lack of page and core affinity awareness of the checkpoint/restart (C/R) mechanism, i.e., application tasks originally pinned to cores may be restarted on different cores, and in case of non-uniform memory architectures (NUMA), quite common today, memory pages associated with tasks on a NUMA node may be associated with a different NUMA node after restart. This work contributes a novel design technique for C/R mechanisms to preserve task-to-core maps and NUMA node specific page affinities across restarts. Experimental results with BLCR, a C/R mechanism, enhanced with affinity awareness demonstrate significant performance benefits of 37%-73% for the NAS Parallel Benchmark codes and 6-12% for NAMD with negligible overheads instead of up to nearly four times longer an execution times without affinity-aware restarts on 16 cores.",

            "Abstract": "The pressing demand to deploy software updates without stopping running programs has fostered much research on live update systems in the past decades. Prior solutions, however, either make strong assumptions on the nature of the update or require extensive and error-prone manual effort, factors which discourage live update adoption.\n This paper presents Mutable Checkpoint-Restart (MCR), a new live update solution for generic (multiprocess and multithreaded) server programs written in C. Compared to prior solutions, MCR can support arbitrary software updates and automate most of the common live update operations. The key idea is to allow the new version to restart as similarly to a fresh program initialization as possible, relying on existing code paths to automatically restore the old program threads and reinitialize a relevant portion of the program data structures. To transfer the remaining data structures, MCR relies on a combination of precise and conservative garbage collection techniques to trace all the global pointers and apply the required state transformations on the fly. Experimental results on popular server programs (Apache httpd, nginx, OpenSSH and vsftpd) confirm that our techniques can effectively automate problems previously deemed difficult at the cost of negligible run-time performance overhead (2% on average) and moderate memory overhead (3.9x on average).",

            "Abstract": "Scaling to a large number of cores with non-uniform communication latency and unpredictable response time may call for viewing a modern many-core architecture as a distributed system. In this view, the cores replicate shared data and ensure consistency among replicas through a message-passing based agreement protocol.\n In this paper, we present the first in-depth study of message-passing agreement on many-cores. In particular, we focus on the possibility of such a protocol being non-blocking. We highlight a number of optimizations that are specific to the many-core environment and present 1Paxos, a new non-blocking agreement protocol that takes up the challenges of this environment.",

            "Abstract": "Many distributed applications deployed on the Internet must operate continuously with no noticeable interruption of service. Such 24/7 availability requirements make the maintenance of these application difficult because fixing bugs or adding new functionality necessitates the online replacement of the software version by the new one, i.e., a \"live update\". Support for \"live update\" is therefore essential to allow software evolution of critical services. While the problem of live update has been widely studied and several techniques have been proposed (e.g., using group communication and replication), we propose in this paper an original approach for the dataflow-based programming model (FBP). An interesting property of FBP is its seamless support for multi-and many-core architectures, which have become the norm in recent generation of servers and Cloud infrastructures. We introduce a framework and new algorithms for implementing coordinated non-blocking updates, which do not only support the replacement of individual software components, but also modifications of structural aspects of the applications independently of the underlying execution infrastructure. These algorithms allow us to transparently orchestrate live updates without halting the executing program. We illustrate and evaluate our approach on a web server application. We present experimental evidence that our live update algorithms are scalable and have negligible impact on availability and performance.",
            "TLDR": "An original approach for the dataflow-based programming model (FBP) with a framework and new algorithms for implementing coordinated non-blocking updates, which do not only support the replacement of individual software components, but also modifications of structural aspects of the applications independently of the underlying execution infrastructure."

Indeed, when handling several millions of users, it is common to operate thousands of servers spread across the globe. Here, replication plays a central role, as it contributes to improve the user experience by hiding failures and by providing acceptable latency. In this work, we claim that atomic multicast, with strong and well-defined properties, is the appropriate abstraction to efficiently design and implement globally scalable distributed systems. We substantiate our claim with the design of two modern online services atop atomic multicast, a strongly consistent key-value store and a distributed log.",

They do so by looking up the results of computations that query the database in a key-value store (KVS) instead of processing them using a relational database management system (RDBMS). These systems incur undesirable race conditions that cause the KVS to produce stale data. This paper presents the IQ framework that provides strong consistency with no modification to the RDBMS. It consists of two non-blocking leases, Inhibit (I) and Quarantine (Q). Ratings obtained from a social networking benchmark named BG show the proposed framework has minimal impact on system performance while providing strong consistency guarantees.",

            "Abstract": "Concomitant with the tremendous growth of online social networking (OSN) platforms are increasing concerns from users about their privacy and the protection of their data. As user data management is usually centralized, OSN providers nowadays have the unprecedented privilege to access every user's private data, which makes large-scale privacy leakage at a single site possible. One way to address this issue is to decentralize user data management and replicate user data at individual end-user machines across the OSN.\n However, such an approach must address new challenges. In particular, it must achieve high availability of the data of every user with minimal replication overhead and without assuming any permanent online storage. At the same time, it needs to provide mechanisms for encrypting user data, controlling access to the data, and synchronizing the replicas. Moreover, it has to scale with large social networks and be resilient and adaptive in handling both high churn of regular participants and attacks from malicious users.\n While recent works in this direction only show limited success, we introduce a new, decentralized OSN called the Self-Organized Universe of People (SOUP). SOUP employs a scalable, robust and secure mirror selection design and can effectively distribute and manage encrypted user data replicas throughout the OSN. An extensive evaluation by simulation and a real-world deployment show that SOUP addresses all aforementioned challenges.",
            "TLDR": "This work introduces a new, decentralized OSN called the Self-Organized Universe of People (SOUP), which employs a scalable, robust and secure mirror selection design and can effectively distribute and manage encrypted user data replicas throughout the OSN."

            "Abstract": "Smartphone sensing enables inference of physical context, while online social networks (OSNs) allow mobile applications to harness users' interpersonal relationships. However, OSNs and smartphone sensing remain disconnected, since obstacles, including the synchronization of mobile sensing and OSN monitoring, inefficiency of smartphone sensors, and privacy concerns, stand in the way of merging the information from these two sources.\n In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of SenSocial, a middleware that automates the process of obtaining and joining OSN and physical context data streams for the development of ubiquitous computing applications. SenSocial enables instantiation, management and aggregation of context streams from multiple remote devices. Through micro-benchmarks we show that SenSocial successfully and efficiently captures OSN and mobile sensed data streams. We developed two prototype applications in order to evaluate our middleware and we demonstrate that SenSocial significantly reduces the amount of programming effort needed for building social sensing applications.",
            "TLDR": "The design, implementation and evaluation of SenSocial are presented, a middleware that automates the process of obtaining and joining OSN and physical context data streams for the development of ubiquitous computing applications and significantly reduces the amount of programming effort needed for building social sensing applications."

            "Abstract": "With the increasing popularity of Software-defined networks (SDN), TCAM memory of switches can be directly accessed by a publish/subscribe middleware to perform filtering operations at low latency. This way two important requirements for a publish/subscribe middleware can be fulfilled: namely bandwidth efficiency and line-rate performance in forwarding messages between producers and consumers. Nevertheless, it is challenging to sustain line-rate performance in the presence of dynamic changes in the interest of producers and consumers. In this paper, we propose and evaluate the PLEROMA middleware to realize publish/subscribe at line-rate and bandwidth efficiently in SDN. PLEROMA offers methods to efficiently reconfigure a deployed topology in the presence of dynamic subscriptions and advertisements. Furthermore, PLEROMA ensures interoperability and independent reconfiguration of multiple controlled SDN networks.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present CrowdWiFi, a novel vehicular middleware to identify and localize roadside WiFi APs that are located outside or inside buildings. Our work is motivated by the recent surge in availability of open WiFi access points (APs) that are enabling opportunistic data services to moving vehicles. Two key elements of CrowdWiFi that provide vehicles with opportunistic WiFi access include (a) an online compressive sensing component and (b) an offline crowdsourcing module. Online compressive sensing (CS) techniques are primarily used to for the coarse-grained estimation of nearby APs along the driving route; here, the received signal strength (RSS) values are recorded at runtime, and the number and locations of APs are recovered immediately based on limited RSS readings. The offline crowdsourcing mechanism assigns the online CS tasks to crowd-vehicles and aggregates answers using a bipartite graphical model. This offline crowdsourcing executes at a crowd-server that iteratively infers the reliability of each crowd-vehicle from the aggregated sensing results and refines the estimation of APs using weighted centroid processing. Extensive simulation results and real testbed experiments confirm that CrowdWiFi can successfully reduce the number of measurements needed for AP recovery, while maintaining satisfactory counting and localization accuracy. In addition, the impact of CrowdWiFi middleware on WiFi handoff and data transmission applications is examined.",

            "Abstract": "Massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs), which are typically supported by large distributed systems, require a scalable, low latency messaging middleware that supports the location-based semantics and the loosely coupled interaction of multiplayer games components. In this paper, we present three different pub/sub-driven designs for a MMOG networking engine that account for the highly interactive and massive nature of these games. Each design uses not only different pub/sub approaches (from topic-based to content-based) but also serves varying degrees of responsibilities. In particular, some of them integrate game functionality, such as interest management, into the network engine. We implement, evaluate, and compare our proposed designs in the MMOG prototype Mammoth. Our real-world results show the viability of pub/sub while at the same time highlighting clear trade-offs between the different designs used, especially in the number and frequency of the various message types, such as subscriptions.",

Modern storage server architectures are multi-threaded and structured as a set of modules, which we call stages. SAAD leverages this to collect stage-level log summaries at runtime and to perform statistical analysis across stage instances. Stages that generate rare execution flows and/or register unusually high duration for regular flows at run-time indicate anomalies. SAAD makes two key contributions: i) limits the search space for root causes, by pinpointing specific anomalous code stages, and ii) reduces compute and storage requirements for log analysis, while preserving accuracy, through a novel technique based on log summarization. We evaluate SAAD on three distributed storage systems: HBase, Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), and Cassandra. We show that, with practically zero overhead, we uncover various anomalies in real-time.",

Archie complies with the State Machine Approach, where the transactional state is fully replicated and total ordered transactions are executed on the replicas. Archie avoids the serial execution after transactions get ordered, which is the typical bottleneck of those protocols, by anticipating the work and using speculation to process transactions in parallel, enforcing a predefined order. The key feature of Archie is to avoid any non-trivial operation to perform post total order's notification, in case the sequencer node remains stable (only a single timestamp increment is needed for committing a transaction). This approach significantly shortens the transaction's critical path. The contention of speculative execution is always kept limited by activating a fixed number of transactions at a time. A comprehensive evaluation, using three competitors and three well known benchmarks, shows that Archie outperforms competitors in all medium/high contention scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Application performance has been and remains one of top five concerns since the inception of cloud computing. A primary determinant of application performance is multi-tenancy or sharing of hardware resources in clouds. While some hardware resources can be partitioned well among VMs (such as CPUs), many others cannot (such as memory bandwidth). In this paper, we focus on understanding the variability in application performance on a cloud and explore ways for an end customer to deal with it. Based on rigorous experiments using CloudSuite, a popular Web2.0 benchmark, running on EC2, we found that interference-induced performance degradation is a reality. On a private cloud testbed, we also observed that interference impacts the choice of best configuration values for applications and middleware. We posit that intelligent reconfiguration of application parameters presents a way for an end customer to reduce the impact of interference. However, tuning the application to deal with interference is challenging because of two fundamental reasons --- the configuration depends on the nature and degree of interference and there are inter-parameter dependencies. We design and implement the IC2 system (Interference-aware Cloud application Configuration) to address the challenges of detection and mitigation of performance interference in clouds. Compared to an interference-agnostic configuration, the proposed solution provides up to 29% and 40% improvement in average response time on EC2 and a private cloud testbed respectively.",

            "Abstract": "Cost Adaptive Multi-queue eviction Policy (CAMP) is an algorithm for a general purpose key-value store (KVS) that manages key-value pairs computed by applications with different access patterns, key-value sizes, and varying costs for each key-value pair. CAMP is an approximation of the Greedy Dual Size (GDS) algorithm in that its eviction policy is as effective as GDS. At the same time, its implementation is as efficient at LRU. Similar to an implementation of LRU using queues, it adapts to changing workload patterns based on the history of requests for different key-value pairs. It is superior to LRU because it considers both the size and cost of key-value pairs to maximize the utility of the available memory across competing applications. We compare CAMP with both LRU and an alternative that requires human intervention to partition memory into pools and assign grouping of key-value pairs to different pools. The results demonstrate CAMP is as fast as LRU while outperforming both LRU and the pooled alternative. We also present results from an implementation of CAMP using Twitter's version of memcached.",

            "Abstract": "While co-locating virtual machines improves utilization in resource shared environments, the resulting performance interference between VMs is difficult to model or predict. QoS sensitive applications can suffer from resource co-location with other less short-term resource sensitive or batch applications. The common practice of overprovisioning resources helps to avoid performance interference and guarantee QoS but leads to low machine utilization. Recent work that relies on static approaches suffer from practical limitations due to assumptions such as a priori knowledge of application behaviour and workload.\n To address these limitations, we present Stay-Away, a generic and adaptive mechanism to mitigate the detrimental effects of performance interference on sensitive applications when co-located with batch applications. Our mechanism complements the allocation decisions of resource schedulers by continuously learning the favourable and unfavourable states of co-execution and mapping them to a state-space representation. Trajectories in this representation are used to predict and prevent any transition towards interference of sensitive applications by proactively throttling the execution of batch applications. The representation also doubles as a template to prevent violations in the future execution of the repeatable sensitive application when co-located with other batch applications. Experimental results with realistic applications show that it is possible to guarantee a high level of QoS for latency sensitive applications while also improving machine utilization.",

In this work, we analyze large enterprise workloads with the goal of understanding how effective are the VM consolidation variants in real world. We observe that burstiness in memory demand is much lower than the burstiness in CPU demand. Further, memory is the more constrained resource in virtualized servers, significantly reducing the potential gains due to dynamic consolidation. We study consolidation planning in four very large data centers and observe that the savings in facilities cost due to dynamic consolidation over static consolidation is not as large as estimated by past studies. Further, the savings over intelligent semi-static consolidation are surprisingly modest in most cases, putting a question mark over the applicability of dynamic consolidation in real world.",

            "Abstract": "Pub/sub is an elegant paradigm for disseminating information efficiently and anonymously among producers (publishers) and consumers (subscribers). However, with current topic and content-based pub/sub approaches it is difficult to formulate subscriptions that adequately and accurately express the interest of the consumers in a semantic information domain. In this paper we introduce GraPS, a pub/sub middleware that provides a publication model based on graphs. Points of interest in the information domain are mapped to nodes, and relationships between points of interest are mapped to edges. Consumers can effectively express their interest in publications by means of graph subscriptions that exploit the properties of nodes and the semantics of the edge relationships. Graph subscriptions do not require complete knowledge of the graph and can be updated whenever the consumer's interest changes. Furthermore, graph subscriptions are automatically updated whenever the information domain changes. We illustrate GraPS by means of three application scenarios and present a set of experiments with an implementation of GraPS based on standard pub/sub middleware.",
            "TLDR": "GraPS is introduced, a pub/sub middleware that provides a publication model based on graphs that exploit the properties of nodes and the semantics of the edge relationships and is automatically updated whenever the information domain changes."

            "Abstract": "Despite suffering from inefficiency and flexibility limitations, the filter-based routing (FBR) algorithm is widely used in content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) systems. To address its limitations, we propose a dynamic destination-based routing algorithm called D-DBR, which decomposes pub/sub into two independent parts: Content-based matching and destination-based multicasting. D-DBR exhibits low event matching cost and high efficiency, flexibility, and robustness for event routing in small scale overlays. To boost scalability, we further complement D-DBR with a new routing algorithm called MERC. MERC divides the overlay into interconnected clusters and applies content-based and destination-based mechanisms to route events inter- and intra-cluster, respectively. We implemented all algorithms in the PADRES pub/sub system. Experimental results show that our algorithms outperform FBR in terms of improving event dissemination throughput by up to 700% and reducing the end-to-end latency by up to 55%.",

            "Abstract": "Content-based publish/subscribe (pub/sub) is an appealing information dissemination paradigm for distributed systems. Consumers of data subscribe to a pub/sub service, typically offered through a distributed broker overlay, and indicate their interests as constraints over the information content. Publishers generate the information flow, which the brokers filter and route to the interested subscribers. Protecting the information confidentiality, and in particular the interests of subscribers, is an important concern when brokers are located in untrusted domains such as public clouds. Encrypted matching techniques allow untrusted brokers to store encrypted subscriptions and match them against encrypted publications. Updates of encryption keys regularly happen in such contexts due to changes in trust relations. These key updates cause the invalidation of stored encrypted subscriptions and force subscribers to re-encrypt and re-submit them. This long and costly operation impacts the pub/sub service continuity and performance. In this paper, we propose a novel technique that allows updating encrypted subscriptions directly at the brokers while maintaining privacy. We present an implementation of the technique for the ASPE encrypted matching scheme and prove the security of our extension. We evaluate its practical effectiveness through a prototype implementation including a dependable key distribution protocol. Our experiments show the ability to handle key updates while preserving service continuity and performance.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes a novel technique that allows updating encrypted subscriptions directly at the brokers while maintaining privacy, and presents an implementation of the technique for the ASPE encrypted matching scheme and proves the security of the extension."

            "Abstract": "Next-generation non-volatile memory (NVM) technologies, such as phase-change memory and memristors, can enable computer systems infrastructure to continue keeping up with the voracious appetite of data-centric applications for large, cheap, and fast storage. Persistent memory has emerged as a promising approach to accessing emerging byte-addressable non-volatile memory through processor load/store instructions. Due to lack of commercially available NVM, system software researchers have mainly relied on emulation to model persistent memory performance. However, existing emulation approaches are either too simplistic, or too slow to emulate large-scale workloads, or require special hardware. To fill this gap and encourage wider adoption of persistent memory, we developed a performance emulator for persistent memory, called Quartz. Quartz enables an efficient emulation of a wide range of NVM latencies and bandwidth characteristics for performance evaluation of emerging byte-addressable NVMs and their impact on applications performance (without modifying or instrumenting their source code) by leveraging features available in commodity hardware. Our emulator is implemented on three latest Intel Xeon-based processor architectures: Sandy Bridge, Ivy Bridge, and Haswell. To assist researchers and engineers in evaluating design decisions with emerging NVMs, we extend Quartz for emulating the application execution on future systems with two types of memory: fast, regular volatile DRAM and slower persistent memory. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach by using a set of specially designed memory-intensive benchmarks and real applications. The accuracy of the proposed approach is validated by running these programs both on our emulation platform and a multisocket (NUMA) machine that can support a range of memory latencies. We show that Quartz can emulate a range of performance characteristics with low overhead and good accuracy (with emulation errors 0.2% - 9%).",

            "Abstract": "Classic caching algorithms leverage recency, access count, and/or other properties of cached blocks at per-block granularity. However, for media such as flash which have performance and wear penalties for small overwrites, implementing cache policies at a larger granularity is beneficial. Recent research has focused on buffering small blocks and writing in large granularities, called containers, but it has not explored the ramifications and best strategies for caching compound blocks consisting of logically distinct, but physically co-located, blocks. Containers may have highly diverse blocks, with mixtures of frequently accessed, infrequently accessed, and invalidated blocks. We propose and evaluate Pannier, a flash cache middleware that provides high performance while extending flash lifespan. Pannier uses three main techniques: (1) leveraging block access counts to manage cache containers, (2) incorporating block liveness as a property to improve flash cache space efficiency, and (3) designing a multi-step feedback controller to ensure a flash cache does not wear out in its lifespan while maintaining performance. Our evaluation shows that Pannier improves flash cache performance and extends lifespan beyond previous per-block and container-aware caching policies. More fundamentally, our investigation highlights the importance of creating new policies for caching compound blocks in flash.",
            "TLDR": "Pannier improves flash cache performance and extends lifespan beyond previous per-block and container-aware caching policies, and highlights the importance of creating new policies for caching compound blocks in flash."

            "Abstract": "SSD based cache solutions are being widely utilized to improve performance in network storage systems. With a goal of providing a cost-effective, high performing SSD cache solution, we propose a new caching solution called SRC (SSD RAID as a Cache) for an array of commodity SSDs. In designing SRC, we borrow both the well-known RAID technique and the log-structured approach and adopt them into the cache layer. In so doing, we explore a wide variety of design choices such as flush issue frequency, write units, forming stripes without parity, and garbage collection through copying rather than destaging that become possible as we make use of RAID and a log-structured approach at the cache level. Using an implementation in Linux under the Device Mapper framework, we quantitatively present and analyze results of the design space options that we considered in our design. Our experiments using realistic workload traces show that SRC performs at least 2 times better in terms of throughput than existing open source solutions. We also consider cost-effectiveness of SRC with a variety of SSD products. In particular, we compare SRC configured with MLC and TLC SATA SSDs and a single high-end NVMe SSD. We find that SRC configured as RAID-5 with low-cost MLC and TLC SATA SSDs generally outperforms that configured with a single high-end SSD in terms of both performance and lifetime per dollars spent.",
            "TLDR": "It is found that SRC configured as RAID-5 with low-cost MLC and TLC SATA SSDs generally outperforms that configured with a single high-end SSD in terms of both performance and lifetime per dollars spent."

            "Abstract": "Client-side apps (e.g., mobile or in-browser) need cloud data to be available in a local cache, for both reads and updates. For optimal user experience and developer support, the cache should be consistent and fault-tolerant. In order to scale to high numbers of unreliable and resource-poor clients, and large database, the system needs to use resources sparingly. The SwiftCloud distributed object database is the first to provide fast reads and writes via a causally-consistent client-side local cache backed by the cloud. It is thrifty in resources and scales well, thanks to consistent versioning provided by the cloud, using small and bounded metadata. It remains available during faults, switching to a different data centre when the current one is not responsive, while maintaining its consistency guarantees. This paper presents the SwiftCloud algorithms, design, and experimental evaluation. It shows that client-side apps enjoy the high performance and availability, under the same guarantees as a remote cloud data store, at a small cost.",

Q-OPT is able to assign different quorum systems to different items and can be used in a large variety of settings, including systems supporting multiple tenants with different profiles, single tenant systems running applications with different requirements, or systems running a single application that exhibits non-uniform access patterns to data. Q-OPT supports automatic and dynamic reconfiguration, using a combination of complementary techniques, including top-k analysis to prioritise quorum adaptation, machine learning to determine the best quorum configuration, and a non-blocking quorum reconfiguration protocol that preserves consistency during reconfiguration. Q-OPT has been implemented as an extension to one of the most popular open-source SDS, namely Openstack's Swift.",

            "Abstract": "The ordering of events is a fundamental problem of distributed computing and has been extensively studied over several decades. From all the available orderings, total ordering is of particular interest as it provides a powerful abstraction for building reliable distributed applications. Unfortunately, deterministic total order algorithms scale poorly and are therefore unfit for modern large-scale applications. The main contribution of this paper is EpTO, a total order algorithm with probabilistic agreement that scales both in the number of processes and events. EpTO provides deterministic safety and probabilistic liveness: integrity, total order and validity are always preserved, while agreement is achieved with arbitrarily high probability. We show that EpTO is well-suited for large-scale dynamic distributed systems: it does not require a global clock nor synchronized processes, and it is highly robust even when the network suffers from large delays and significant churn and message loss.",
            "TLDR": "EpTO is shown to be well-suited for large-scale dynamic distributed systems: it does not require a global clock nor synchronized processes, and it is highly robust even when the network suffers from large delays and significant churn and message loss."

Such data stores typically support both distribution and replication of vertexes across physical nodes. While distribution provides better load balancing of requests, replication is necessary to achieve improved availability and performance. However, most of these systems still manage replicated memory by hand, resulting in expensive efforts to fix dangling references and memory leaks to ensure referential integrity. In this paper, we present a novel Garbage Collection (GC) algorithm that safely eliminates both acyclic and cyclic garbage with support for replicated data. Our algorithm provides minimum impact on applications' performance, is completely decentralized and has no coordination requirements. We evaluate our approach against previous solutions and show that our solution is efficient while imposing very little overhead on applications' performance.",

            "Abstract": "With its unlimited scalability and on-demand access to computation and storage, a virtualized cloud platform is the perfect match for big data systems such as Hadoop. However, virtualization introduces a significant amount of overhead to I/O intensive applications due to device virtualization and VMs or I/O threads scheduling delay. In particular, device virtualization causes significant CPU overhead as I/O data needs to be moved across several protection boundaries. We observe that such overhead especially affects the I/O performance of the Hadoop distributed file system (HDFS). In fact, data read from an HDFS datanode VM must go through virtual devices multiple times --- incurring non-negligible virtualization overhead --- even though both client VM and datanode VM may be running on the same machine. In this paper, we propose vRead, a programmable framework which connects I/O flows from HDFS applications directly to their data. vRead enables direct \"reads\" to the disk images of datanode VMs from the hypervisor. By doing so, vRead can significantly avoid device virtualization overhead, resulting in improved I/O throughput as well as CPU savings for Hadoop workloads and other applications relying on HDFS.",

            "Abstract": "Consumer cloud storage (CCS) services have become popular among users for storing and synchronizing files via apps installed on their devices. A single CCS, however, has intrinsic limitations on networking performance, service reliability, and data security. To overcome these limitations, we present UniDrive, a CCS app that synergizes multiple CCSs (multi-cloud) by using only few simple public RESTful Web APIs. UniDrive follows a server-less, client-centric design, in which synchronization logic is purely implemented at client devices and all communication is conveyed through file upload and download operations. Strong consistency of the metadata is guaranteed via a quorum-based distributed mutual-exclusive lock mechanism. UniDrive improves reliability and security by judiciously distributing erasure coded files across multiple CCSs. To boost networking performance, UniDrive leverages all available clouds to maximize parallel transfer opportunities, but the key insight behind is the concept of data block over-provisioning and dynamic scheduling. This suite of techniques masks the diversified and varying network conditions of the underlying clouds, and exploits more the faster clouds via a simple yet effective in-channel probing scheme. Extensive experimental results on the global Amazon EC2 platform and a real-world trial by 272 users confirmed significantly superior and consistent sync performance of UniDrive over any single CCS.",

            "Abstract": "The era of big data has led to the emergence of new systems for real-time distributed stream processing, e.g., Apache Storm is one of the most popular stream processing systems in industry today. However, Storm, like many other stream processing systems lacks an intelligent scheduling mechanism. The default round-robin scheduling currently deployed in Storm disregards resource demands and availability, and can therefore be inefficient at times. We present R-Storm (Resource-Aware Storm), a system that implements resource-aware scheduling within Storm. R-Storm is designed to increase overall throughput by maximizing resource utilization while minimizing network latency. When scheduling tasks, R-Storm can satisfy both soft and hard resource constraints as well as minimizing network distance between components that communicate with each other. We evaluate R-Storm on set of micro-benchmark Storm applications as well as Storm applications used in production at Yahoo! Inc. From our experimental results we conclude that R-Storm achieves 30-47% higher throughput and 69-350% better CPU utilization than default Storm for the micro-benchmarks. For the Yahoo! Storm applications, R-Storm outperforms default Storm by around 50% based on overall throughput. We also demonstrate that R-Storm performs much better when scheduling multiple Storm applications than default Storm.",

            "Abstract": "GPU and multicore hardware architectures are commonly used in many different application areas to accelerate problem solutions relative to single CPU architectures. The typical approach to accessing these hardware architectures requires embedding logic into the programming language used to construct the application; the two primary forms of embedding are: calls to API routines to access the concurrent functionality, or pragmas providing concurrency hints to a language compiler such that particular blocks of code are targeted to the concurrent functionality. The former approach is verbose and semantically bankrupt, while the success of the latter approach is restricted to simple, static uses of the functionality. This paper presents an extension to an existing actor-based programming model and runtime to support executing applications on parallel hardware architectures. Besides the glove-like fit of a kernel to the actor abstraction, quantitative code analysis shows that actor-based kernels are always significantly simpler than API-based coding, and generally simpler than pragma-based coding. The structuring of applications in this manner, enables the runtime to automate the initialisation and interaction with these parallel hardware platforms. Performance measurements show that the overheads of actor-based kernels are commensurate to API-based kernels, and range from equivalent to vastly improved for pragma-based annotations, both for sample and real-world applications.",

            "Abstract": "Consensus protocols employed in Byzantine fault-tolerant systems are notoriously compute intensive. Unfortunately, the traditional approach to execute instances of such protocols in a pipelined fashion is not well suited for modern multi-core processors and fundamentally restricts the overall performance of systems based on them. To solve this problem, we present the consensus-oriented parallelization (COP) scheme, which disentangles consecutive consensus instances and executes them in parallel by independent pipelines; or to put it in the terminology of our main target, today's processors: COP is the introduction of superscalarity to the field of consensus protocols. In doing so, COP achieves 2.4 million operations per second on commodity server hardware, a factor of 6 compared to a contemporary pipelined approach measured on the same code base and a factor of over 20 compared to the highest throughput numbers published for such systems so far. More important, however, is: COP provides up to 3 times as much throughput on a single core than its competitors and it can make use of additional cores where other approaches are confined by the slowest stage in their pipeline. This enables Byzantine fault tolerance for the emerging market of extremely demanding transactional systems and gives more room for conventional deployments to increase their quality of service.",

            "Abstract": "Consensus is a basic building block in middleware configuration services [4, 18]. While such services are designed to tolerate crash failures in asynchronous settings, they may not stand up well to Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks. Specifically, malicious clients can carefully craft workloads that substantially degrade the performance of many state-of-the-art consensus protocols. By exploiting protocol-specific vulnerabilities, attackers can constantly force the protocol participants to slow execution paths [8]. In this paper, we investigate designing consensus protocols that provide acceptable performance under DoS attacks that aim to saturate the bandwidth of protocol participants. We propose a new asynchronous consensus protocol that we call Turtle Consensus. Turtle Consensus employs previously proposed crash-tolerant consensus protocols and exploits their diverse characteristics by switching between protocols from round to round. Some protocols are fast under benign conditions but their performance suffers greatly under attack. Other protocols may not be as fast under benign conditions, but their performance may actually benefit from naive attacks. By reconfiguring the consensus protocol on-the-fly we can achieve the best of both worlds: excellent performance in benign scenarios and acceptable performance while under attack, even if the client workload is high. We evaluate Turtle Consensus against adversarial scenarios where at most one process may fail and show that we can achieve better performance than existing crash-tolerant protocols under attack.",

Unfortunately, existing (typically incremental) checkpointing frameworks incur substantial performance overhead in high-frequency memory checkpointing applications, thus discouraging their adoption in practice. This paper presents Speculative Memory Checkpointing (SMC), a new low-overhead technique for high-frequency memory checkpointing. Our motivating analysis identifies key bottlenecks in existing frameworks and demonstrates that the performance of traditional incremental checkpointing strategies in high-frequency checkpointing scenarios is not optimal. To fill the gap, SMC relies on working set estimation algorithms to eagerly checkpoint the memory pages that belong to the writable working set of the running program and only lazily checkpoint the memory pages that do not. Our experimental results demonstrate that SMC is effective in reducing the performance overhead of prior solutions, is robust to variations in the workload, and incurs modest memory overhead compared to traditional incremental checkpointing.",

            "Abstract": "Virtual machine migration is a useful and widely used workload management technique. However, the overhead of moving gigabytes of data across machines, racks, or even data centers limits its applicability. According to a recent study by IBM [7], the number of distinct servers visited by a migrating VM is small; often just two. By storing a checkpoint on each server, a subsequent incoming migration of the same VM must transfer less data over the network. Our analysis shows that for short migration intervals of 2 hours on average 50% to 70% of the checkpoint can be reused. For longer migration intervals of up to 24 hours still between 20% to 50% can be reused. In addition, we compared different methods to reduce the migration traffic. We find that content-based redundancy elimination consistently achieves better results than relying on dirty page tracking alone. Sometimes the difference is only a few percent, but can reach up to 50% and more. Our empirical measurements with a QEMU-based prototype confirm the reduction in migration traffic and time.",

            "Abstract": "Modern data center clusters are shifting from dedicated single framework clusters to shared clusters. In such shared environments, cluster schedulers typically utilize preemption by simply killing jobs in order to achieve resource priority and fairness during peak utilization. This can cause significant resource waste and delay job response time. In this paper, we propose using suspend-resume mechanisms to mitigate the overhead of preemption in cluster scheduling. Instead of killing preempted jobs or tasks, our approach uses a system level, application-transparent checkpointing mechanism to save the progress of jobs for resumption at a later time when resources are available. To reduce the preemption overhead and improve job response times, our approach uses adaptive preemption to dynamically select appropriate preemption mechanisms (e.g., kill vs. suspend, local vs. remote restore) according to the progress of a task and its suspend-resume overhead. By leveraging fast storage technologies, such as non-volatile memory (NVM), our approach can further reduce the preemption penalty to provide better QoS and resource efficiency. We implement the proposed approach and conduct extensive experiments via Google cluster trace-driven simulations and applications on a Hadoop cluster. The results demonstrate that our approach can significantly reduce the resource and power usage and improve application performance over existing approaches. In particular, our implementation on the next generation Hadoop YARN platform achieves up to a 67% reduction in resource wastage, 30% improvement in overall job response time times and 34% reduction in energy consumption over the current YARN scheduler.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes using suspend-resume mechanisms to mitigate the overhead of preemption in cluster scheduling, and uses adaptive preemption to dynamically select appropriate preemption mechanisms according to the progress of a task and its suspend- Resume overhead."

            "Abstract": "Configuring large distributed computations is a challenging task. Efficiently executing distributed computations requires configuration tuning based on careful examination of application and hardware properties. Considering the large number of parameters and impracticality of using trial and error in a production environment, programmers tend to make these decisions based on their experience and rules of thumb. Such configurations can lead to underutilized and costly clusters, and missed deadlines. In this paper, we present a new methodology for determining desired hardware and software configuration parameters for distributed computations. The key insight behind this methodology is to build a response surface that captures how applications perform under different hardware and software configuration. Such a model can be built through iterated experiments using the real system, or, more efficiently, using a simulator. The resulting model can then generate recommendations for configuration parameters that are likely to yield the desired results even if they have not been tried either in simulation or in real-life. The process can be iterated to refine previous predictions and achieve better results. We have implemented this methodology in a configuration recommendation system for MapReduce 2.0 applications. Performance measurements show that representative applications achieve up to 5× performance improvement when they use the recommended configuration parameters compared to the default ones.",

            "Abstract": "A growing number of organizations are seeking to analyze extra large graphs in a timely and resource-efficient manner. With some graphs containing well over a billion elements, these organizations are turning to distributed graph-computing platforms that can scale out easily in existing data-centers and clouds. Unfortunately such platforms usually impose programming models that can be ill suited to typical graph computations, fundamentally undermining their potential benefits. In this paper, we consider how the emblematic problem of link-prediction can be implemented efficiently in gather-apply-scatter (GAS) platforms, a popular distributed graph-computation model. Our proposal, called SNAPLE, exploits a novel highly-localized vertex scoring technique, and minimizes the cost of data flow while maintaining prediction quality. When used within GraphLab, SNAPLE can scale to very large graphs that a standard implementation of link prediction on GraphLab cannot handle. More precisely, we show that SNAPLE can process a graph containing 1.4 billions edges on a 256 cores cluster in less than three minutes, with no penalty in the quality of predictions. This result corresponds to an over-linear speedup of 30 against a 20-core standalone machine running a non-distributed state-of-the-art solution.",

            "Abstract": "Energy-efficiency is a critical concern in continuously-running mobile applications, such as those for health and context monitoring. An attractive approach to saving energy in such applications is to defer the execution of delay-tolerant operations until a time when they would consume less energy. However, introducing delays to save power may have a detrimental impact on the user experience. To address this problem, we present Tempus, a new approach to managing the trade-off between energy savings and delay. Tempus saves power by enabling programmers to annotate power-hungry operations with states that specify when the operation can be executed to save energy. The impact of power management on timeliness is managed by associating delay budgets with objects that contain time-sensitive data. A static analysis and the run-time service ensure that power management policies will not delay an object more than its assigned budget. We demonstrate the expressive power of Tempus through a case study of optimizing two real-world applications. Furthermore, laboratory experiments show that Tempus may effectively manage the energy-delay trade-off on realistic workloads. For example, in a news application, five Tempus annotations may be used to create a policy that reduces the latency of downloading images 10 times compared to the original implementation without affecting energy consumption. Our experiments also indicate that the overhead of tracking budgets in Tempus is small.",
            "TLDR": "Tempus is presented, a new approach to managing the trade-off between energy savings and delay that saves power by enabling programmers to annotate power-hungry operations with states that specify when the operation can be executed to save energy."

            "Abstract": "Fine-grained power monitoring, which refers to power monitoring at the server level, is critical to the efficient operation and energy saving of datacenters. Fined-grained power monitoring, however, is extremely challenging in legacy datacenters that host server systems not equipped with power monitoring sensors. Installing power monitoring hardware at the server level not only incurs high costs but also complicates the maintenance of high-density server clusters and enclosures. In this paper, we present a zero-cost, purely software-based solution to this challenging problem. We use a novel technique of non-intrusive power disaggregation (NIPD) that establishes power mapping functions (PMFs) between the states of servers and their power consumption, and infer the power consumption of each server with the aggregated power of the entire datacenter. We implement and evaluate NIPD over a real-world datacenter with 326 nodes. The results show that our solution can provide high precision power estimation at the rack level, with mean relative error of 2.63%, and the server level, with mean relative error of 10.27% and 8.17% for the estimation of idle power and peak power, respectively.",
            "TLDR": "A novel technique of non-intrusive power disaggregation (NIPD) is used that establishes power mapping functions (PMFs) between the states of servers and their power consumption, and infer the power consumption of each server with the aggregated power of the entire datacenter."

            "Abstract": "Virtualization is used in data center and cloud environments to decouple applications from the hardware they run on. Hardware virtualization and operating system level virtualization are two prominent technologies that enable this. Containers, which use OS virtualization, have recently surged in interest and deployment. In this paper, we study the differences between the two virtualization technologies. We compare containers and virtual machines in large data center environments along the dimensions of performance, manageability and software development. We evaluate the performance differences caused by the different virtualization technologies in data center environments where multiple applications are running on the same servers (multi-tenancy). Our results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads. We also evaluate differences in the management frameworks which control deployment and orchestration of containers and VMs. We show how the different capabilities exposed by the two virtualization technologies can affect the management and development of applications. Lastly, we evaluate novel approaches which combine hardware and OS virtualization.",
            "TLDR": "The results show that co-located applications can cause performance interference, and the degree of interference is higher in the case of containers for certain types of workloads."

            "Abstract": "Software Defined Networking (SDN) promises greater flexibility for directing packet flows, and Network Function Virtualization promises to enable dynamic management of software-based network functions. However, the current divide between an intelligent control plane and an overly simple, stateless data plane results in the inability to exploit the flexibility of a software based network. In this paper we propose SDNFV, a framework that expands the capabilities of network processing-and-forwarding elements to flexibly manage packet flows, while retaining both a high performance data plane and an easily managed control plane. SDNFV proposes a hierarchical control framework where decisions are made across the SDN controller, a host-level manager, and individual VMs to best exploit state available at each level. This increases the network's flexibility compared to existing SDNs where controllers often make decisions solely based on the first packet header of a flow. SDNFV intelligently places network services across hosts and connects them in sequential and parallel chains, giving both the SDN controller and individual network functions the ability to enhance and update flow rules to adapt to changing conditions. Our prototype demonstrates how to efficiently and flexibly reroute flows based on data plane state such as packet payloads and traffic characteristics.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed file systems built for Big Data Analytics and cluster file systems built for traditional applications have very different functionality requirements, resulting in separate storage silos. In enterprises, there is often the need to run analytics on data generated by traditional applications that is stored on cluster file systems. The absence of a single data store that can serve both classes of applications leads to data duplication and hence, increased storage costs, along with the cost of moving data between the two kinds of file systems. It is difficult to unify these two classes of file systems since the classes of applications that use them have very different requirements, in terms of performance, data layout, consistency and fault tolerance. In this paper, we look at the design differences of two file systems, IBM's GPFS [1] and the open source Hadoop's Distributed File System (HDFS) [2] and propose a way to reconcile these design differences. We design and implement a shim layer over GPFS that can be used by analytical applications to efficiently access data stored in GPFS. Through our evaluation, we provide quantitative results that show that our system performs at par with with HDFS, for most Big Data applications while retaining all the guarantees provided by traditional cluster file systems.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed stream processing engines continuously execute series of operators on data streams. Horizontal scaling is achieved by deploying multiple instances of each operator in order to process data tuples in parallel. As the application is distributed on an increasingly high number of servers, the likelihood that the stream is sent to a different server for each operator increases. This is particularly important in the case of stateful applications that rely on keys to deterministically route messages to a specific instance of an operator. Since network is a bottleneck for many stream applications, this behavior significantly degrades their performance. Our objective is to improve stream locality for stateful stream processing applications. We propose to analyse traces of the application to uncover correlations between the keys used in successive routing operations. By assigning correlated keys to instances hosted on the same server, we significantly reduce network consumption and increase performance while preserving load balance. Furthermore, this approach is executed online, so that the assignment can automatically adapt to changes in the characteristics of the data. Data migration is handled seamlessly with each routing configuration update. We implemented and evaluated our protocol using Apache Storm, with a real workload consisting of geo-tagged Flickr pictures as well as Twitter publications. Our results show a significant improvement in throughput.",

            "Abstract": "Live migration of Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) consumes significant amounts of time and resources, imposing relevant application performance overhead. This problem is specially hard when memory modified by applications changes faster than it can be transferred through the network (to a remote host). Current solutions to this problem resort to several techniques which depend on high-speed networks and application throttling, require lots of CPU time to compress memory, or need explicit assistance from the application. We propose a novel approach, Garbage Collector (GC) assisted JVM Live Migration for Java Server Applications (ALMA). ALMA makes a snapshot to be migrated containing a minimal amount of application state, by taking into account the amount of reachable memory (i.e. live data) detected by the GC. The main novelty of ALMA is the following: ALMA analyzes the JVM heap looking for regions in which a collection phase is advantageous w.r.t. the network bandwidth available (i.e. it pays to collect because a significant amount of memory will not be part of the snapshot). ALMA is implemented on OpenJDK 8 and extends CRIU (a Linux disk-based process checkpoint/restore tool) to support process live migration over the network. We evaluate ALMA using well-known JVM performance benchmarks (SPECjvm2008 and DaCapo), and by comparing it to other previous approaches. ALMA shows very good performance results.",

            "Abstract": "Performance isolation is enforced in the cloud by setting to each virtual machine (VM) a given fraction of each resource type (physical memory, processor, and IO bandwidth). However, microarchitectural-level resources such as processor's caches cannot be divided and allocated to VMs: they are globally shared among all VMs which compete for their use, leading to cache contention. Therefore, performance isolation and predictability are compromised. This situation is devastating for HPC applications. In this paper, we propose a software solution (called Kyoto) to this issue, inspired by the polluters pay principle. A VM is said to pollute the cache if it provokes significant cache replacements which impact the performance of other VMs. Henceforth, using the Kyoto system, the provider can encourage HPC cloud users to book pollution permits for their VMs. We have implemented Kyoto in several virtualization systems including both general purpose systems (Xen and KVM) and specialized HPC systems (Pisces).",
            "TLDR": "Using the Kyoto system, the provider can encourage HPC cloud users to book pollution permits for their VMs by encouraging them to pollute the cache if it provokes significant cache replacements which impact the performance of other VMs."

            "Abstract": "Caching is an important aspect of today's web enterprise systems, enhancing performance and reducing access frequency to the backend storage server. However, when implemented as an independent component, such as when using Memcached, access to the remote cache can lead to considerable overhead and delay. Instead, in this paper we propose a cooperative and integrated cache framework where each application server has its own local cache but can also access the caches of other servers. Our solution dynamically distributes objects across caches and requests across servers such that the load is equally distributed across servers and servers find the objects they need for request execution in their local cache most of the time. The challenge is to handle the complex workloads of current e-commerce sites where requests can access more than one object and change the object set they access over time, and different request types access overlapping sets of objects. As such, we look at a whole range of distribution mechanisms and analyze their behavior in detail. We evaluated the various alternatives using the YCSB and RUBiS benchmarks, showing that our approach is applicable in different dynamic workload scenarios and is able to autonomously capture workload changes and adapt instantly.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes a cooperative and integrated cache framework where each application server has its own local cache but can also access the caches of other servers, and dynamically distributes objects across caches and requests across servers such that the load is equally distributed across servers."

            "Abstract": "Application performance monitoring in large data centers relies on either deploying expensive and specialized hardware at fixed locations or heavily customizing applications and collecting logs spread across thousands of servers. Such an endeavor makes performance diagnosis a time-consuming task for cloud providers and a problem beyond the control of cloud customers. We address this problem using emerging software defined paradigms such as Software Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization as well as big data technologies. In this paper, we propose NetAlytics: a non-intrusive distributed performance monitoring system for cloud data centers. NetAlytics deploys customized monitors in the middle of the network which are transparent to end host applications, and leverages a real-time big data framework to analyze application behavior in a timely manner. NetAlytics can scale to packet rates of 40Gbps using only four monitoring cores and fifteen processing cores. Its placement algorithm can be tuned to minimize network bandwidth cost or server resources, and can reduce monitoring traffic overheads by a factor of 4.5. We present experiments that demonstrates how NetAlytics can be used to troubleshoot performance problems in load balancers, present comprehensive performance analysis, and provide metrics that drive automation tools, all while providing both low overhead monitors and scalable analytics.",

            "Abstract": "With the use of external cloud services such as Google Docs or Evernote in an enterprise setting, the loss of control over sensitive data becomes a major concern for organisations. It is typical for regular users to violate data disclosure policies accidentally, e.g. when sharing text between documents in browser tabs. Our goal is to help such users comply with data disclosure policies: we want to alert them about potentially unauthorised data disclosure from trusted to untrusted cloud services. This is particularly challenging when users can modify data in arbitrary ways, they employ multiple cloud services, and cloud services cannot be changed. To track the propagation of text data robustly across cloud services, we introduce imprecise data flow tracking, which identifies data flows implicitly by detecting and quantifying the similarity between text fragments. To reason about violations of data disclosure policies, we describe a new text disclosure model that, based on similarity, associates text fragments in web browsers with security tags and identifies unauthorised data flows to untrusted services. We demonstrate the applicability of imprecise data tracking through BrowserFlow, a browser-based middleware that alerts users when they expose potentially sensitive text to an untrusted cloud service. Our experiments show that BrowserFlow can robustly track data flows and manage security tags for documents with no noticeable performance impact.",

            "Abstract": "Content-based routing (CBR) is a powerful model that supports scalable asynchronous communication among large sets of geographically distributed nodes. Yet, preserving privacy represents a major limitation for the wide adoption of CBR, notably when the routers are located in public clouds. Indeed, a CBR router must see the content of the messages sent by data producers, as well as the filters (or subscriptions) registered by data consumers. This represents a major deterrent for companies for which data is a key asset, as for instance in the case of financial markets or to conduct sensitive business-to-business transactions. While there exists some techniques for privacy-preserving computation, they are either prohibitively slow or too limited to be usable in real systems. In this paper, we follow a different strategy by taking advantage of trusted hardware extensions that have just been introduced in off-the-shelf processors and provide a trusted execution environment. We exploit Intel's new software guard extensions (SGX) to implement a CBR engine in a secure enclave. Thanks to the hardware-based trusted execution environment (TEE), the compute-intensive CBR operations can operate on decrypted data shielded by the enclave and leverage efficient matching algorithms. Extensive experimental evaluation shows that SGX adds only limited overhead to insecure plaintext matching outside secure enclaves while providing much better performance and more powerful filtering capabilities than alternative software-only solutions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to demonstrate the practical benefits of SGX for privacy-preserving CBR.",

            "Abstract": "Shuffle grouping is a technique used by stream processing frameworks to share input load among parallel instances of stateless operators. With shuffle grouping each tuple of a stream can be assigned to any available operator instance, independently from any previous assignment. A common approach to implement shuffle grouping is to adopt a Round-Robin policy, a simple solution that fares well as long as the tuple execution time is almost the same for all the tuples. However, such an assumption rarely holds in real cases where execution time strongly depends on tuple content. As a consequence, parallel stateless operators within stream processing applications may experience unpredictable unbalance that, in the end, causes undesirable increase in tuple completion times. In this paper we propose Online Shuffle Grouping (OSG), a novel approach to shuffle grouping aimed at reducing the overall tuple completion time. OSG estimates the execution time of each tuple, enabling a proactive and online scheduling of input load to the target operator instances. Sketches are used to efficiently store the otherwise large amount of information required to schedule incoming load. We provide a probabilistic analysis and illustrate, through both simulations and a running prototype, its impact on stream processing applications.",

            "Abstract": "Live testing is used in the context of continuous delivery and deployment to test changes or new features in the production environment. This includes canary releases, dark launches, A/B tests, and gradual rollouts. Oftentimes, multiple of these live testing practices need to be combined (e.g., running an A/B test after a dark launch). Manually administering such multi-phase live testing strategies is a daunting task for developers or release engineers. In this paper, we introduce a formal model for multi-phase live testing, and present Bifrost as a Node.js based prototype implementation that allows developers to define and automatically enact complex live testing strategies. We extensively evaluate the runtime behavior of Bifrost in three rollout scenarios of a microservice-based case study application, and conclude that the performance overhead of our prototype is at or below 8 ms for most scenarios. Further, we show that more than 100 parallel strategies can be enacted even on cheap public cloud instances.",

            "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) applications, systems and services are subject to law. We argue that for the IoT to develop lawfully, there must be technical mechanisms that allow the enforcement of specified policy, such that systems align with legal realities. The audit of policy enforcement must assist the apportionment of liability, demonstrate compliance with regulation, and indicate whether policy correctly captures legal responsibilities. As both systems and obligations evolve dynamically, this cycle must be continuously maintained. This poses a huge challenge given the global scale of the IoT vision. The IoT entails dynamically creating new services through managed and flexible data exchange. Data management is complex in this dynamic environment, given the need to both control and share information, often across federated domains of administration. We see middleware playing a key role in managing the IoT. Our vision is for a middleware-enforced, unified policy model that applies end-to-end, throughout the IoT. This is because policy cannot be bound to things, applications, or administrative domains, since functionality is the result of composition, with dynamically formed chains of data flows. We have investigated the use of Information Flow Control (IFC) to manage and audit data flows in cloud computing; a domain where trust can be well-founded, regulations are more mature and associated responsibilities clearer. We feel that IFC has great potential in the broader IoT context. However, the sheer scale and the dynamic, federated nature of the IoT pose a number of significant research challenges.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing, while ubiquitous, still suffers from trust issues, especially for applications managing sensitive data. Third-party coordination services such as ZooKeeper and Consul are fundamental building blocks for cloud applications, but are exposed to potentially sensitive application data. Recently, hardware trust mechanisms such as Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) offer trusted execution environments to shield application data from untrusted software, including the privileged Operating System (OS) and hypervisors. Such hardware support suggests new options for securing third-party coordination services. We describe SecureKeeper, an enhanced version of the ZooKeeper coordination service that uses SGX to preserve the confidentiality and basic integrity of ZooKeeper-managed data. SecureKeeper uses multiple small enclaves to ensure that (i) user-provided data in ZooKeeper is always kept encrypted while not residing inside an enclave, and (ii) essential processing steps that demand plaintext access can still be performed securely. SecureKeeper limits the required changes to the ZooKeeper code base and relies on Java's native code support for accessing enclaves. With an overhead of 11%, the performance of SecureKeeper with SGX is comparable to ZooKeeper with secure communication, while providing much stronger security guarantees with a minimal trusted code base of a few thousand lines of code.",
            "TLDR": "This work describes SecureKeeper, an enhanced version of the ZooKeeper coordination service that uses SGX to preserve the confidentiality and basic integrity of ZooK Keeper-managed data, and provides much stronger security guarantees with a minimal trusted code base of a few thousand lines of code."

            "Abstract": "An increasing amount of business processes are inherently knowledge-intense and require ad-hoc decision making. Flexible modeling approaches such as the Case Management Model and Notation (CMMN) were designed to support such scenarios. At the same time, many processes involve participants and data from different organizations across the globe. Often, legal regulations such as data privacy render centralized execution engines impractical because data must be processed where it is collected. Instead, distributed approaches to coordinate process and data are necessary for supporting geo-scale execution. In this paper, we present a fully geo-distributed workflow engine that implements the core execution semantics of CMMN, the Guard-Stage-Milestone (GSM) meta-model, and supports locality of process data by distributing data and control-flow management over a loosely-coupled publish/subscribe infrastructure. We present a novel context-aware mapping (CAM) of GSM into Workflow Units (WFUs), representing the unit of distribution in our system. We have developed our distributed workflow execution engine over PADRES, an enterprise-grade event management system. Evaluation results show that our approach scales well with process size and degree of distribution and that CAM improves throughput and latency by up to 5X compared to the baseline mapping (BLM).",

            "Abstract": "Designing low-latency cloud-based applications that are adaptable to unpredictable workloads and efficiently utilize modern cloud computing platforms is hard. The actor model is a popular paradigm that can be used to develop distributed applications: actors encapsulate state and communicate with each other by sending events. Consistency is guaranteed if each event only accesses a single actor, thus eliminating potential data races and deadlocks. However it is nontrivial to provide consistency for concurrent events spanning across multiple actors. This paper addresses this problem by introducing AEON: a framework that provides the following properties: (i) Programmability: programmers only need to reason about sequential semantics when reasoning about concurrency resulting from multi-actor events; (ii) Scalability: AEON runtime protocol guarantees serializable and starvation-free execution of multi-actor events, while maximizing parallel execution; (iii) Elasticity: AEON supports fine-grained elasticity enabling the programmer to transparently migrate individual actors without violating the consistency or entailing significant performance overheads. Our empirical results show that it is possible to combine the best of all the above three worlds without compromising on the application performance.",

            "Abstract": "Mobile phone sensing contributes to changing the way we approach science: massive amount of data is being contributed across places and time, and paves the way for advanced analyses of numerous phenomena at an unprecedented scale. Still, despite the extensive research work on enabling resource-efficient mobile phone sensing with a very-large crowd, key challenges remain. One challenge is facing the introduction of a new heterogeneity dimension in the traditional middleware research landscape. The middleware must deal with the heterogeneity of the contributing crowd in addition to the system's technical heterogeneities. In order to tackle these two heterogeneity dimensions together, we have been conducting a large-scale empirical study in cooperation with the city of Paris. Our experiment revolves around the public release of a mobile app for urban pollution monitoring that builds upon a dedicated mobile crowd-sensing middleware. In this paper, we report on the empirical analysis of the resulting mobile phone sensing efficiency from both technical and social perspectives, in face of a large and highly heterogeneous population of participants. We concentrate on the data originating from the 20 most popular phone models of our user base, which represent contributions from over 2,000 users with 23 million observations collected over 10 months. Following our analysis, we introduce a few recommendations to overcome -technical and crowd- heterogeneities in the implementation of mobile phone sensing applications and supporting middleware.",
            "TLDR": "This paper reports on the empirical analysis of the resulting mobile phone sensing efficiency from both technical and social perspectives, in face of a large and highly heterogeneous population of participants."

            "Abstract": "An important feature of modern GPU architectures is variable occupancy. Occupancy measures the ratio between the actual number of threads actively running on a GPU and the maximum number of threads that can be scheduled on a GPU. High-occupancy execution enables a large number of threads to run simultaneously and to hide memory latency, but may increase resource contention. Low-occupancy execution leads to less resource contention, but is less capable of hiding memory latency. Occupancy tuning is an important and challenging problem. A program running at two different occupancy levels can have three to four times difference in performance. We introduce Orion, the first GPU program occupancy tuning framework. The Orion framework automatically generates and chooses occupancy-adaptive code for any given GPU program. It is capable of finding the (near-)optimal occupancy level by combining static and dynamic tuning techniques. We demonstrate the efficiency of Orion with twelve representative benchmarks from the Rodinia benchmark suite and CUDA SDK evaluated on two different GPU architectures, obtaining up to 1.61 times speedup, 62.5% memory resource saving, and 6.7% energy saving compared to the baseline of optimized code compiled by nvcc.",
            "TLDR": "The Orion framework automatically generates and chooses occupancy-adaptive code for any given GPU program, capable of finding the (near-)optimal occupancy level by combining static and dynamic tuning techniques."

            "Abstract": "This paper presents Atum, a group communication middleware for a large, dynamic, and hostile environment. At the heart of Atum lies the novel concept of volatile groups: small, dynamic groups of nodes, each executing a state machine replication protocol, organized in a flexible overlay. Using volatile groups, Atum scatters faulty nodes evenly among groups, and then masks each individual fault inside its group. To broadcast messages among volatile groups, Atum runs a gossip protocol across the overlay. We report on our synchronous and asynchronous (eventually synchronous) implementations of Atum, as well as on three representative applications that we build on top of it: A publish/subscribe platform, a file sharing service, and a data streaming system. We show that (a) Atum can grow at an exponential rate beyond 1000 nodes and disseminate messages in polylogarithmic time (conveying good scalability); (b) it smoothly copes with 18% of nodes churning every minute; and (c) it is impervious to arbitrary faults, suffering no performance decay despite 5.8% Byzantine nodes in a system of 850 nodes.",
            "TLDR": "It is shown that Atum can grow at an exponential rate beyond 1000 nodes and disseminate messages in polylogarithmic time, and it is impervious to arbitrary faults, suffering no performance decay despite 5.8% Byzantine nodes in a system of 850 nodes."

            "Abstract": "A priori, locking seems easy: To protect shared data from concurrent accesses, it is sufficient to lock before accessing the data and unlock after. Nevertheless, making locking efficient requires fine-tuning (a) the granularity of locks and (b) the locking strategy for each lock and possibly each workload. As a result, locking can become very complicated to design and debug. We present GLS, a middleware that makes lock-based programming simple and effective. GLS offers the classic lock-unlock interface of locks. However, in contrast to classic lock libraries, GLS does not require any effort from the programmer for allocating and initializing locks, nor for selecting the appropriate locking strategy. With GLS, all these intricacies of locking are hidden from the programmer. GLS is based on GLK, a generic lock algorithm that dynamically adapts to the contention level on the lock object. GLK is able to deliver the best performance among simple spinlocks, scalable queue-based locks, and blocking locks. Furthermore, GLS offers several debugging options for easily detecting various lock-related issues, such as deadlocks. We evaluate GLS and GLK on two modern hardware platforms, using several software systems (i.e., HamsterDB, Kyoto Cabinet, Memcached, MySQL, SQLite) and show how GLK improves their performance by 23% on average, compared to their default locking strategies. We illustrate the simplicity of using GLS and its debugging facilities by rewriting the synchronization code for Memcached and detecting two potential correctness issues.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed stream computing has emerged as a technology that can satisfy the low latency, high throughput demands of big data. Stream computing naturally exposes pipeline, task and data parallelism. Meeting the throughput and latency demands of online big data requires exploiting such parallelism across heterogeneous clusters. When a single job is running on a homogeneous cluster, load balancing is important. When multiple jobs are running across a heterogeneous cluster, load balancing becomes critical. The data parallel regions of distributed streaming applications are particularly sensitive to load imbalance, as their overall speed is gated by the slowest performer. We propose a dynamic load balancing technique based on a system artifact: the TCP blocking rate per connection. We build a function for each connection based on this blocking rate, and obtain a balanced load distribution by modeling the problem as a minimax separable resource allocation problem. In other words, we minimize the maximum value of these functions. Our model achieves local load balancing that does not require any global information. We test our model in a real streaming system, and demonstrate that it is able to detect differences in node capacities, determine the correct load distribution for those capacities and dynamically adapt to changes in the system.",

            "Abstract": "The quality of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models are very sensitive to many different adjustable parameters that are set before training even begins, commonly called hyperparameters. Efficient hyperparameter exploration is of great importance to practitioners in order to find high-quality models with affordable time and cost. This is however a challenging process due to a huge search space, expensive training runtime, sparsity of good configurations, and scarcity of time and resources. We develop a scheduling algorithm POP that quickly identifies among promising, opportunistic and poor configurations of hyperparameters. It infuses probabilistic model-based classification with dynamic scheduling and early termination to jointly optimize quality and cost. We also build a comprehensive hyperparameter exploration infrastructure, HyperDrive, to support existing and future scheduling algorithms for a wide range of usage scenarios across different ML/DL frameworks and learning domains. We evaluate POP and HyperDrive using complex and deep models. The results show that we speedup the training process by up to 6.7x compared with basic approaches like random/grid search and up to 2.1x compared with state-of-the-art approaches while achieving similar model quality compared with prior work.",

            "Abstract": "Major cloud computing operators provide powerful monitoring tools to understand the current (and prior) state of the distributed systems deployed in their infrastructure. While such tools provide a detailed monitoring mechanism at scale, they also pose a significant challenge for the application developers/operators to transform the huge space of monitored metrics into useful insights. These insights are essential to build effective management tools for improving the efficiency, resiliency, and dependability of distributed systems. This paper reports on our experience with building and deploying Sieve---a platform to derive actionable insights from monitored metrics in distributed systems. Sieve builds on two core components: a metrics reduction framework, and a metrics dependency extractor. More specifically, Sieve first reduces the dimensionality of metrics by automatically filtering out unimportant metrics by observing their signal over time. Afterwards, Sieve infers metrics dependencies between distributed components of the system using a predictive-causality model by testing for Granger Causality. We implemented Sieve as a generic platform and deployed it for two microservices-based distributed systems: OpenStack and Share-Latex. Our experience shows that (1) Sieve can reduce the number of metrics by at least an order of magnitude (10 -- 100×), while preserving the statistical equivalence to the total number of monitored metrics; (2) Sieve can dramatically improve existing monitoring infrastructures by reducing the associated overheads over the entire system stack (CPU---80%, storage---90%, and network---50%); (3) Lastly, Sieve can be effective to support a wide-range of workflows in distributed systems---we showcase two such workflows: Orchestration of autoscaling, and Root Cause Analysis (RCA).",

            "Abstract": "High performance computing (HPC) applications, such as metagenomics and other big data systems, need to store and analyze huge volumes of semi-structured data. Such applications often rely on NoSQL-based datastores, and optimizing these databases is a challenging endeavor, with over 50 configuration parameters in Cassandra alone. As the application executes, database workloads can change rapidly from read-heavy to write-heavy ones, and a system tuned with a read-optimized configuration becomes suboptimal when the workload becomes write-heavy. In this paper, we present a method and a system for optimizing NoSQL configurations for Cassandra and ScyllaDB when running HPC and metagenomics workloads. First, we identify the significance of configuration parameters using ANOVA. Next, we apply neural networks using the most significant parameters and their workload-dependent mapping to predict database throughput, as a surrogate model. Then, we optimize the configuration using genetic algorithms on the surrogate to maximize the workload-dependent performance. Using the proposed methodology in our system (Rafiki), we can predict the throughput for unseen workloads and configuration values with an error of 7.5% for Cassandra and 6.9-7.8% for ScyllaDB. Searching the configuration spaces using the trained surrogate models, we achieve performance improvements of 41% for Cassandra and 9% for ScyllaDB over the default configuration with respect to a read-heavy workload, and also significant improvement for mixed workloads. In terms of searching speed, Rafiki, using only 1/10000-th of the searching time of exhaustive search, reaches within 15% and 9.5% of the theoretically best achievable performances for Cassandra and ScyllaDB, respectively---supporting optimizations for highly dynamic workloads.",

            "Abstract": "Rivulet is a fault-tolerant distributed platform for running smart-home applications; it can tolerate failures typical for a home environment (e.g., link losses, network partitions, sensor failures, and device crashes). In contrast to existing cloud-centric solutions, which rely exclusively on a home gateway device, Rivulet leverages redundant smart consumer appliances (e.g., TVs, Refrigerators) to spread sensing and actuation across devices local to the home, and avoids making the Smart-Home Hub a single point of failure. Rivulet ensures event delivery in the presence of link loss, network partitions and other failures in the home, to enable applications with reliable sensing in the case of sensor failures, and event processing in the presence of device crashes. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Rivulet, and evaluate its effective handling of failures in a smart home.",
            "TLDR": "Rivulet ensures event delivery in the presence of link loss, network partitions and other failures in the home, to enable applications with reliable sensing in the case of sensor failures, and event processing in the absence of device crashes."

            "Abstract": "Mobile apps make extensive use of GPUs on smartphones and tablets to access Web content. To support pervasive Web content, we introduce three key OS techniques for binary graphics compatibility necessary to build a real-world system to run iOS and Android apps together on the same smartphone or tablet. First diplomat usage patterns manage resources to bridge proprietary iOS and Android graphics implementations. Second, thread impersonation allows a single thread-specific context to be shared amongst multiple threads using multiple iOS and Android personas. Third, dynamic library replication allows multiple, independent instances of the same library to be loaded in a single process to support iOS apps on Android while using multiple graphics API versions at the same time. We use these techniques to build a system prototype, and demonstrate that it runs widely-used iOS apps, including apps such as Safari that use the popular GPU-accelerated WebKit framework, using a Google Nexus tablet running Android.",
            "TLDR": "This work introduces three key OS techniques for binary graphics compatibility necessary to build a real-world system to run iOS and Android apps together on the same smartphone or tablet, and demonstrates that it runs widely-used iOS apps."

            "Abstract": "The rapid adoption of smartphones with different types of advanced sensors has led to an increasing trend in the usage of mobile crowdsensing applications, e.g., to create hyper-local weather maps. However, the high energy consumption of crowdsensing, chiefly due to expensive network communication, has been found to be detrimental to the wide-spread adoption. We propose a framework, called Sense-Aid, that can provide energy-efficient mobile crowdsensing service, coexisting with the cellular network. There are two key innovations in Sense-Aid beyond prior work (Piggyback Crowdsensing-Sensys13)---the middleware running on the cellular network edge to orchestrate multiple devices present in geographical proximity to suppress redundant data collection and communication. It understands the state of each device (radio state, battery state, etc.) to decide which ones should be selected for crowdsensing activities at any point in time. It also provides a simple programming abstraction to help with the development of crowdsensing applications. We show the benefit of Sense-Aid by conducting a user study consisting of 60 students in our campus, compared to a baseline periodic data collection method and Piggyback Crowdsensing. We find that energy saving is 93.3% for Sense-Aid compared with Piggyback Crowdsensing in a representative case which requires 2 devices to provide barometric values within an area of a circle whose radius is 1 kilometer and requires periodic data collection every 5 minutes for a 90-minute test. The selection algorithm of Sense-Aid also ensures reasonable fairness in the use of the different devices.",
            "TLDR": "A framework, called Sense-Aid, that can provide energy-efficient mobile crowdsensing service, coexisting with the cellular network, and provides a simple programming abstraction to help with the development of crowdsensing applications is proposed."

            "Abstract": "Onboarding network functions onto current clouds requires labor-intensive configuration of the virtual environment. Developers need to dimension the resources available to each virtual machine such as CPU and memory, define thresholds for scaling dynamically and create configuration files that operators can use to execute the network services. This process is time consuming and dependent on the server architecture. As resources are managed on an individual virtual machine basis, services cannot be orchestrated end to end without significant expertise. In this paper, we argue that much of the manual configuration needed for onboarding services onto a cloud can be automated. Moreover, we can automatically generate abstractions that consider services end-to-end and enable their holistic orchestration. We propose a framework that benchmarks network services during the onboarding process and generates an elastic model which relates workload mixes to resource requirements, identifies component dependencies and automates service operation on heterogeneous stacks. We have evaluated our framework using a real-time communication service that handles multiple classes of workloads. Results show that underprovisioning can be eliminated for regular daily traffic, reducing resource provisioning time by at least 5X for the most stressing traffic surges, while improving key performance indicators by at least 40%.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes a framework that benchmarks network services during the onboarding process and generates an elastic model which relates workload mixes to resource requirements, identifies component dependencies and automates service operation on heterogeneous stacks."

            "Abstract": "Data analytic applications built upon big data processing frameworks such as Apache Spark are an important class of applications. Many of these applications are not latency-sensitive and thus can run as batch jobs in data centers. By running multiple applications on a computing host, task co-location can significantly improve the server utilization and system throughput. However, effective task co-location is a non-trivial task, as it requires an understanding of the computing resource requirement of the co-running applications, in order to determine what tasks, and how many of them, can be co-located. State-of-the-art co-location schemes either require the user to supply the resource demands which are often far beyond what is needed; or use a one-size-fits-all function to estimate the requirement, which, unfortunately, is unlikely to capture the diverse behaviors of applications. In this paper, we present a mixture-of-experts approach to model the memory behavior of Spark applications. We achieve this by learning, off-line, a range of specialized memory models on a range of typical applications; we then determine at runtime which of the memory models, or experts, best describes the memory behavior of the target application. We show that by accurately estimating the resource level that is needed, a co-location scheme can effectively determine how many applications can be co-located on the same host to improve the system throughput, by taking into consideration the memory and CPU requirements of co-running application tasks. Our technique is applied to a set of representative data analytic applications built upon the Apache Spark framework. We evaluated our approach for system throughput and average normalized turnaround time on a multi-core cluster. Our approach achieves over 83.9% of the performance delivered using an ideal memory predictor. We obtain, on average, 8.69x improvement on system throughput and a 49% reduction on turnaround time over executing application tasks in isolation, which translates to a 1.28x and 1.68x improvement over a state-of-the-art co-location scheme for system throughput and turnaround time respectively.",
            "TLDR": "It is shown that by accurately estimating the resource level that is needed, a co-location scheme can effectively determine how many applications can be co-located on the same host to improve the system throughput, by taking into consideration the memory and CPU requirements of co-running application tasks."

            "Abstract": "Developers use Machine Learning (ML) platforms to train ML models and then deploy these ML models as web services for inference (prediction). A key challenge for platform providers is to guarantee response-time Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for inference workloads while maximizing resource efficiency. Swayam is a fully distributed autoscaling framework that exploits characteristics of production ML inference workloads to deliver on the dual challenge of resource efficiency and SLA compliance. Our key contributions are (1) model-based autoscaling that takes into account SLAs and ML inference workload characteristics, (2) a distributed protocol that uses partial load information and prediction at frontends to provision new service instances, and (3) a backend self-decommissioning protocol for service instances. We evaluate Swayam on 15 popular services that were hosted on a production ML-as-a-service platform, for the following service-specific SLAs: for each service, at least 99% of requests must complete within the response-time threshold. Compared to a clairvoyant autoscaler that always satisfies the SLAs (i.e., even if there is a burst in the request rates), Swayam decreases resource utilization by up to 27%, while meeting the service-specific SLAs over 96% of the time during a three hour window. Microsoft Azure's Swayam-based framework was deployed in 2016 and has hosted over 100,000 services.",

            "Abstract": "Traditionally, active storage techniques have been proposed to move computation tasks to storage nodes in order to exploit data locality. However, we argue in this paper that active storage is ill-suited for cloud storage for two reasons: 1. Lack of elasticity: Computing can only scale out with the number of storage nodes; and 2. Resource Contention: Sharing compute resources can produce interferences in the storage system. Serverless computing is now emerging as a promising alternative for ensuring painless scalability, and also, for simplifying the development of disaggregated computing tasks. Here we present an innovative data-driven serverless computing middleware for object storage. It is a lightweight compute solution that allows users to create small, stateless functions that intercept and operate on data flows in a scalable manner without the need to manage a server or a runtime environment. We demonstrate through different use cases how our solution scales with minimal overhead, while getting rid of the resource contention problems incurred by active storage tasks.",

            "Abstract": "Multipath TCP enables remarkable optimizations for throughput, load balancing, and mobility in today's networks. The design space of Multipath TCP scheduling, i.e., the application-aware mapping of packets to paths, is largely unexplored due to its inherent complexity. Evidence in this paper suggests that an application-aware scheduling decision, if leveraged right, pushes Multipath TCP beyond throughput optimization and thereby provides benefits for a wide range of applications. This paper introduces a high-level programming model that enables application-defined Multipath TCP scheduling. We provide an efficient interpreter and eBPF-based runtime environment for the Linux Kernel, enabling isolated application-defined schedulers in multi-tenancy environments. In combination with a high-level API, our work closes the gap between scheduler specification and deployment. We show the strength of our programming model by implementing seven novel schedulers tackling diverse objectives. Our real world measurements, for example, of an application- and preference-aware scheduler, show that the programming model enables timely scheduling decisions to retain fine-grained throughput objectives. Further measurements of a novel HTTP/2-aware scheduler show significantly improved interactions with upper-layer protocols, e.g., an optimized dependency resolution, while preserving path preferences.",
            "TLDR": "This paper provides an efficient interpreter and eBPF-based runtime environment for the Linux Kernel, enabling isolated application-defined schedulers in multi-tenancy environments and closes the gap between scheduler specification and deployment."

            "Abstract": "Big Data applications suffer from unpredictable and unacceptably high pause times due to bad memory management (Garbage Collection, GC) decisions. This is a problem for all applications but it is even more important for applications with low pause time requirements such as credit-card fraud detection or targeted website advertisement systems, which can easily fail to comply with Service Level Agreements due to long GC cycles (during which the application is stopped). This problem has been previously identified and is related to Big Data applications keeping in memory (for a long period of time, from the GC's perspective) massive amounts of data objects. Memory management approaches have been proposed to reduce the GC pause time by allocating objects with similar lifetimes close to each other. However, they either do not provide a general solution for all types of Big Data applications (thus only solving the problem for a specific set of applications), and/or require programmer effort and knowledge to change/annotate the application code. This paper proposes POLM2, a profiler that automatically: i) estimates application allocation profiles based on execution records, and ii) instruments application bytecode to help the GC taking advantage of the profiling information. Thus, no programmer effort is required to change the source code to allocate objects according to their lifetimes. POLM2 is implemented for the OpenJDK HotSpot Java Virtual Machine 8 and uses NG2C, a recently proposed GC which supports multi-generational pretenuring. Results show that POLM2 is able to: i) achieve pauses as low as NG2C (which requires manual source code modification), and ii) significantly reduce application pauses by up to 80% when compared to G1 (default collector in OpenJDK). POLM2 does not negatively impact neither application throughput nor memory utilization.",
            "TLDR": "POLM2 is a profiler that automatically estimates application allocation profiles based on execution records, and instruments application bytecode to help the GC taking advantage of the profiling information, and no programmer effort is required to change the source code to allocate objects according to their lifetimes."

            "Abstract": "Distributed Complex Event Processing (DCEP) is a paradigm to infer the occurrence of complex situations in the surrounding world from basic events like sensor readings. In doing so, DCEP operators detect event patterns on their incoming event streams. To yield high operator throughput, data parallelization frameworks divide the incoming event streams of an operator into overlapping windows that are processed in parallel by a number of operator instances. In doing so, the basic assumption is that the different windows can be processed independently from each other. However, consumption policies enforce that events can only be part of one pattern instance; then, they are consumed, i.e., removed from further pattern detection. That implies that the constituent events of a pattern instance detected in one window are excluded from all other windows as well, which breaks the data parallelism between different windows. In this paper, we tackle this problem by means of speculation: Based on the likelihood of an event's consumption in a window, subsequent windows may speculatively suppress that event. We propose the SPECTRE framework for speculative processing of multiple dependent windows in parallel. Our evaluations show an up to linear scalability of SPECTRE with the number of CPU cores.",

            "Abstract": "We investigate the use of content-based publish/subscribe for data dissemination in large-scale applications with expressive filtering requirements. In particular, we focus on top-k subscription filtering, where a publication is delivered only to the k best ranked subscribers, as ordered using expressive semantics such as relevance, fairness, and diversity. The naive approach to perform filtering early at the publisher edge works only if complete knowledge of the subscriptions is available, which is not compatible with the well-established covering optimization in scalable content-based publish/subscribe systems. We propose an efficient rank-cover technique to reconcile top-k subscription filtering with covering. We extend the covering model to support top-k and describe a novel algorithm for forwarding subscriptions to publishers while maintaining correctness. We also establish a framework for supporting different types of ranking semantics and propose an implementation to support fairness. Finally, we compare our solutions to a baseline covering system and perform sensitivity analysis to demonstrate that our optimized rank-cover algorithm retains both covering and fairness while achieving properties advantageous to our targeted workloads. In a typical setting, our optimized solution is scalable, selects fairly, and provides over 81% of the covering benefit.",

            "Abstract": "Approximate computing aims for efficient execution of workflows where an approximate output is sufficient instead of the exact output. The idea behind approximate computing is to compute over a representative sample instead of the entire input dataset. Thus, approximate computing --- based on the chosen sample size --- can make a systematic trade-off between the output accuracy and computation efficiency. Unfortunately, the state-of-the-art systems for approximate computing primarily target batch analytics, where the input data remains unchanged during the course of computation. Thus, they are not well-suited for stream analytics. This motivated the design of StreamApprox--- a stream analytics system for approximate computing. To realize this idea, we designed an online stratified reservoir sampling algorithm to produce approximate output with rigorous error bounds. Importantly, our proposed algorithm is generic and can be applied to two prominent types of stream processing systems: (1) batched stream processing such as Apache Spark Streaming, and (2) pipelined stream processing such as Apache Flink. To showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm, we implemented StreamApprox as a fully functional prototype based on Apache Spark Streaming and Apache Flink. We evaluated StreamApprox using a set of microbenchmarks and real-world case studies. Our results show that Spark- and Flink-based StreamApprox systems achieve a speedup of 1.15×---3× compared to the respective native Spark Streaming and Flink executions, with varying sampling fraction of 80% to 10%. Furthermore, we have also implemented an improved baseline in addition to the native execution baseline --- a Spark-based approximate computing system leveraging the existing sampling modules in Apache Spark. Compared to the improved baseline, our results show that StreamApprox achieves a speedup of 1.1×---2.4× while maintaining the same accuracy level.",

            "Abstract": "The exploitation of user search queries by search engines is at the heart of their economic model. As consequence, offering private Web search functionalities is essential to the users who care about their privacy. Nowadays, there exists no satisfactory approach to enable users to access search engines in a privacy-preserving way. Existing solutions are either too costly due to the heavy use of cryptographic mechanisms (e.g., private information retrieval protocols), subject to attacks (e.g., Tor, TrackMeNot, GooPIR) or rely on weak adversarial models (e.g., PEAS). This paper introduces X-Search, a novel private Web search mechanism building on the disruptive Software Guard Extensions (SGX) proposed by Intel. We compare X-Search to its closest competitors, Tor and PEAS, using a dataset of real web search queries. Our evaluation shows that: (1) X-Search offers stronger privacy guarantees than its competitors as it operates under a stronger adversarial model; (2) it better resists state-of-the-art re-identification attacks; and (3) from the performance perspective, X-Search outperforms its competitors both in terms of latency and throughput by orders of magnitude.",
            "TLDR": "X-Search is introduced, a novel private Web search mechanism building on the disruptive Software Guard Extensions (SGX) proposed by Intel and it is shown that it offers stronger privacy guarantees than its competitors as it operates under a stronger adversarial model."

            "Abstract": "Web applications hosted on the cloud are exposed to cyberattacks and can be compromised by HTTP requests that exploit vulnerabilities. Platform as a Service (PaaS) offerings often provide a backup service that allows restoring application state after a serious attack, but all valid state changes since the last backup are lost. We propose Rectify, a new approach to recover from intrusions on applications running in a PaaS. Rectify is a service designed to be deployed alongside the application in a PaaS container. It does not require modifications to the software and the recovery can be performed by a system administrator. Machine learning techniques are used to associate the requests received by the application to the statements issued to the database. Rectify was evaluated using three widely used web applications - Wordpress, LimeSurvey and MediaWiki - and the results show that the effects of malicious requests can be removed whilst preserving the valid application data.",

            "Abstract": "The wide adoption of SMP virtual machines (VMs) and resource consolidation present challenges to efficiently executing multi-threaded programs in the cloud. An important problem is the semantic gaps between the guest OS and the hypervisor. The well-known lock-holder preemption (LHP) and lock-waiter preemption (LWP) problems are examples of such semantic gaps, in which the hypervisor is unaware of the activities in the guest OS and adversely deschedules virtual CPUs (vCPUs) that are executing in critical sections. Existing studies have focused on inferring a high-level semantic state of the guest OS to aid hypervisor-level scheduling so as to avoid the LHP and LWP problems. In this work, we find a reverse semantic gap - the guest OS is oblivious of the scheduling events at the hypervisor, leaving the potential of addressing the LHP and LWP problems in the guest OS unexploited. Inspired by scheduler activations (SAs) in hybrid threading, we proposed interference-resilient scheduling (IRS), a guest-hypervisor coordinated approach to enhancing load balancing in the guest. IRS informs the guest OS before vCPU preemption happens at the hypervisor to activate in-guest load balancing. As such, critical threads on preempted vCPUs can be migrated to other running vCPUs so that the LHP and LWP problems are all alleviated. Experimental results with Xen and Linux guests show as much as 42%, 43%, and 46% performance improvement for parallel programs with blocking, spinning synchronizations, and multithreaded server workloads, respectively.",
            "TLDR": "Inspired by scheduler activations in hybrid threading, interference-resilient scheduling (IRS) is proposed, a guest-hypervisor coordinated approach to enhancing load balancing in the guest that informs the guest OS before vCPU preemption happens at the hypervisor to activate in-guest load balancing."

            "Abstract": "Derivative clouds, light weight application containers provisioned in virtual machines, are becoming viable and cost-effective options for infrastructure and software-based services. Ubiquitous dynamic memory management techniques in virtualized systems are centralized at the hypervisor and are ineffective in nested derivative cloud setups. In this paper, we highlight the challenges in management of memory resources in derivative cloud systems. Hypervisor caching, an enabler of centralized disk cache management, provides flexible memory or non-volatile memory management at the hypervisor to improve the resource usage efficiency and performance of applications. Existing hypervisor caching solutions have limited effectiveness in nested setups due to their nesting agnostic design, centralized management model and lack of holistic view of memory management. We propose DoubleDecker, a decentralized disk caching framework, realized through guest OS and hypervisor cooperation, with support for efficient memory management in derivative clouds. The DoubleDecker hypervisor caching framework, an integral part of our proposed solution, provides interfaces for differentiated cache partitioning and management in nested setups and is equipped to handle both memory and SSD based caching stores. We demonstrate the flexibility of DoubleDecker to handle dynamic and changing memory provisioning requirements and its capability to simultaneously provision memory across multiple levels. Such multi-level configurations cannot be explored by centralized designs and are a key feature of DoubleDecker. Our experimentation with DoubleDecker demonstrates that application performance can be consistently improved due to the flexible policy framework for disk caching. With our setup, we report an average performance improvement of 4x and a maximum of 11x.",

            "Abstract": "Disaster Recovery (DR) is a crucial feature to ensure availability and data protection in modern information systems. A common DR approach requires the replication of services in a set of virtual machines running in the cloud as backups. This leads to considerable monetary costs and managing efforts to keep such cloud VMs. We present Ginja, a DR solution for transactional database management systems (DBMS) that uses only cloud storage services such as Amazon S3. Ginja works at file-system level to efficiently capture and replicate data updates to a remote cloud storage service, achieving three important goals: (1) reduces the costs for maintaining a cloud-based DR to less than one dollar per month for relevant databases' sizes and workloads (up to 222 x less than the traditional approach of having a DBMS replica in a cloud VM); (2) allows a precise control of the operational costs, durability and performance trade-offs; and (3) introduces a small performance overhead to the DBMS (e.g., less than 5% overhead for the TPC-C workload with ≈ 10 seconds of data loss in case of disasters).",

            "Abstract": "With the rapid growth in e-commerce, large-scale promotional activities have become a popular concept. However, when the existing system cannot be adjusted efficiently to adapt to the tremendous traffic in the promotion period, which is hundreds of times more than the volume on normal days, it be-comes a bottleneck that restricts the continuous growth of the online business. Traditional capacity prediction methods have been proven to be incapable of making accurate predictions for such special scenarios, because of a variety of unpredictable system bottlenecks. Simulation testing in a completely new test environment for such a large scale has a number of defects and limitations, such as the high cost of setting up the environment and the difficulty of testing the entire environment. Moreover, bottlenecks found in the test server may be different from those in the production server. We investigated online simulations in the production environment and built a complete simulation test system called All-Sparks. This solution solved a long-standing problem of simulation testing with large traffic in the production environment without causing any data pollution. The simulation test revealed hundreds of bottlenecks under a high workload pressure every year to eliminate the hidden problems caused by new applications. The final capacity evaluation result was deviated by less than 5% from the actual capacity, and the error rate was small (<2%); both of these are significant improvements over the traditional prediction results. This solution also provided a framework with good expansibility to multiple scenarios other than stress testing.",

            "Abstract": "The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is designed to handle massive amounts of data, preferably stored in very large files. The poor performance of HDFS in managing small files has long been a bane of the Hadoop community. In many production deployments of HDFS, almost 25% of the files are less than 16 KB in size and as much as 42% of all the file system operations are performed on these small files. We have designed an adaptive tiered storage using in-memory and on-disk tables stored in a high-performance distributed database to efficiently store and improve the performance of the small files in HDFS. Our solution is completely transparent, and it does not require any changes in the HDFS clients or the applications using the Hadoop platform. In experiments, we observed up to 61 times higher throughput in writing files, and for real-world workloads from Spotify our solution reduces the latency of reading and writing small files by a factor of 3.15 and 7.39 respectively.",
            "TLDR": "This work has designed an adaptive tiered storage using in-memory and on-disk tables stored in a high-performance distributed database to efficiently store and improve the performance of the small files in HDFS."

            "Abstract": "Cloud applications are appealing targets to attackers, yet current cloud infrastructures have few ways of helping defend their customers from attacks. However, the use of virtual machines, and the economy of scale found in cloud platforms, provides an opportunity to offer strong security guarantees to tenants at low cost to the cloud provider. We present CRIMES, an evidence based, modular security framework for cloud platforms that uses speculative execution coupled with memory introspection tools to detect malicious behavior in real time. By buffering VM outputs (i.e., outgoing network packets and disk writes) until a scan has been completed, CRIMES gives strong guarantees about the amount of damage an attack can do, while minimizing overheads. When an attack is detected, CRIMES rolls back to a recent checkpoint and performs automated forensic analysis to help pinpoint the source of an attack. Our evaluation demonstrates that CRIMES incurs less overhead compared to memory protection tools such as AddressSanitizer, while offering valuable forensic analysis for buffer overflow attacks and malware detection across multiple applications and the OS.",

            "Abstract": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) are emerging as important drivers for GPU (Graphical Processing Unit) usage. Routinely, now, cloud offerings include GPU-capable VMs, and GPUs are used for training and testing DNNs. A popular way to run inference (or testing) tasks with DNNs is to use middleware called a serving system. Tensorflow-Serving (TF-Serving) is an example of a DNN serving system. In this paper, we consider the problem of carefully scheduling multiple concurrent DNNs in a serving system on a single GPU to achieve fairness or service differentiation objectives, a capability crucial to cloud-based TF-Serving offerings. In scheduling DNNs, we face two challenges: how to schedule, and switch between, different DNN jobs at low overhead; and, how to account for their usage. Our system, Olympian, extends TF-Serving to enable fair sharing of a GPU across multiple concurrent large DNNs at low overhead, a capability TF-Serving by itself is not able to achieve. Specifically, Olympian can run concurrent instances of several large DNN models such as Inception, ResNet, GoogLeNet, AlexNet and VGG, provide each with an equal share of the GPU, while interleaving them at timescales of 1-2 ms, and incurring an overhead of less than 2%. It achieves this by leveraging the predictability of GPU computations to profile GPU resource usage models offline, then using these to achieve low overhead switching between DNNs.",

            "Abstract": "The ubiquity of data streams in different fields of computing has led to the emergence of Stream Processing Systems (SPSs) used to program applications that extract insights from unbounded sequences of data items. Streaming applications demand various kinds of optimizations. Most of them are aimed at increasing throughput and reducing processing latency, and need cost models used to analyze the steady-state performance by capturing complex aspects like backpressure and bottleneck detection. In those systems, the tendency is to support dynamic optimizations of running applications which, although with a substantial run-time overhead, are unavoidable in case of unpredictable workloads. As an orthogonal direction, this paper proposes SpinStreams, a static optimization tool able to leverage cost models that programmers can use to detect and understand the inefficiencies of an initial application design. SpinStreams suggests optimizations for restructuring applications by generating code to be run on the SPS. We present the theory behind our optimizations, which cover more general classes of application structures than the ones studied in the literature so far. Then, we assess the accuracy of our models in Akka, an actor-based streaming framework providing a Java and Scala API.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed transactions on modern RDMA clusters promise high throughput and low latency for scale-out workloads. As such, they can be particularly beneficial to large OLTP workloads, which require both. However, achieving good performance requires tuning the physical layout of the data store to the application and the characteristics of the underlying hardware. Manually tuning the physical design is error-prone, as well as time-consuming, and it needs to be repeated when the workload or the hardware change. In this paper we present SPADE, a physical design tuner for OLTP workloads in FaRM, a main memory distributed computing platform that leverages modern networks with RDMA capabilities. SPADE automatically decides on the partitioning of data, tunes the index and storage parameters, and selects the right mix of direct remote data accesses and function shipping to maximize performance. To achieve this, SPADE combines information derived from the workload and the schema with low-level hardware and network performance characteristics gathered through micro-benchmarks. Using SPADE, the tuned physical design achieves significant throughput and latency improvements over a manual design for two widely used OLTP benchmarks, TATP and TPC-C, sometimes using counter-intuitive tuning decisions.",
            "TLDR": "SPADE is presented, a physical design tuner for OLTP workloads in FaRM, a main memory distributed computing platform that leverages modern networks with RDMA capabilities that achieves significant throughput and latency improvements over a manual design for two widely used OLTP benchmarks."

            "Abstract": "Developing a silver bullet software cache management policy is a daunting task due to the variety of potential workloads. In this paper, we investigate an adaptivity mechanism for software cache management schemes which offer tuning parameters targeted at the frequency vs. recency bias in the workload. The goal is automatic tuning of the parameters for best performance based on the workload without any manual intervention. We study two approaches for this problem, a hill climbing solution and an indicator based solution. In hill climbing, we repeatedly reconfigure the system hoping to find its best setting. In the indicator approach, we estimate the workloads' frequency vs. recency bias and adjust the parameters accordingly in a single swoop. We apply these adaptive mechanisms to two recent software management schemes. We perform an extensive evaluation of the schemes and adaptation mechanisms over a large selection of workloads with varying characteristics. With these, we derive a parameterless software cache management policy that is competitive for all tested workloads.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud-backed file systems provide on-demand, high-availability, scalable storage. Their security may be improved with techniques such as erasure codes and secret sharing to fragment files and encryption keys in several clouds. Attacking the server-side of such systems involves penetrating one or more clouds, which can be extremely difficult. Despite all these benefits, a weak side remains: the client-side. The client devices store user credentials that, if stolen or compromised, may lead to confidentiality, integrity, and availability violations. In this paper we propose RockFS, a cloud-backed file system framework that aims to make the client-side of such systems resilient to attacks. RockFS protects data in the client device and allows undoing unintended file modifications.",

            "Abstract": "This paper studies the costs and trade-offs of providing transactional consistent reads in a distributed storage system. We identify the following dimensions: read consistency, read delay (latency), and data freshness. We show that there is a three-way trade-off between them, which can be summarised as follows: (i) it is not possible to ensure at the same time order-preserving (e.g., causally-consistent) or atomic reads, Minimal Delay, and maximal freshness; thus, reading data that is the most fresh without delay is possible only in a weakly-isolated mode; (ii) to ensure atomic or order-preserving reads at Minimal Delay imposes to read data from the past (not fresh); (iii) however, order-preserving minimal-delay reads can be fresher than atomic; (iv) reading atomic or order-preserving data at maximal freshness may block reads or writes indefinitely. Our impossibility results hold independently of other features of the database, such as update semantics (totally ordered or not) or data model (structured or unstructured). Guided by these results, we modify an existing protocol to ensure minimal-delay reads (at the cost of freshness) under atomic-visibility and causally-consistent semantics. Our experimental evaluation supports the theoretical results.",

            "Abstract": "Gemini is a distributed crash recovery protocol for persistent caches. When a cache instance fails, Gemini assigns other cache instances to process its reads and writes. Once the failed instance recovers, Gemini starts to recover its persistent content while using it to process reads and writes immediately. Gemini does so while guaranteeing read-after-write consistency. It also transfers the working set of the application to the recovering instance to maximize its cache hit ratio. Our evaluation shows that Gemini restores hit ratio two orders of magnitude faster than a volatile cache. Working set transfer is particularly effective with workloads that exhibit an evolving access pattern.",

            "Abstract": "Device-to-device (D2D) communication technologies are growing in availability and popularity and are commonly used to facilitate applications in Internet of Things (IoT) environments. Such environments are characterized by heterogeneous devices, often employing diverse communication technologies with varying energy consumption, discovery ranges, and transmission rates. These complexities pose a daunting setting for the development of IoT applications that could leverage direct communication with proximal mobile and embedded devices. While current approaches focus either on device discovery in the IoT setting or content transfer assuming established communication channels, none facilitate the intelligent discovery of useful devices and the seamless formation of temporary D2D connections to transfer content directly between devices. Our Omni middleware provides both of these features critical in the development of applications that leverage proximal devices in IoT settings. Using Omni, we demonstrate the feasibility of building applications that use heterogeneous D2D communication channels in an efficient and realistic (in terms of energy and time) manner.",

            "Abstract": "Data usage is a significant concern, particularly in smartphone applications, M2M communications and for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Messages in these domains are often exchanged with a backend infrastructure using publish/subscribe (pub/sub). Shared dictionary compression has been shown to reduce data usage in pub/sub networks beyond that obtained using well-known techniques, such as DEFLATE, gzip and delta encoding, but such compression requires manual configuration, which increases the operational complexity. To address this challenge, we design a new dictionary maintenance algorithm called PreDict that adjusts its operation over time by adapting its parameters to the message stream and that amortizes the resulting compression-induced bandwidth overhead by enabling high compression ratios. PreDict observes the message stream, takes the costs specific to pub/sub into account and uses machine learning and parameter fitting to adapt the parameters of dictionary compression to match the characteristics of the streaming messages continuously over time. The primary goal is to reduce the overall bandwidth of data dissemination without any manual parameterization. PreDict reduces the overall bandwidth by 72.6% on average. Furthermore, the technique reduces the computational overhead by ≈ 2x for publishers and by ≈ 1.4x for subscribers compared to the state of the art using manually selected parameters. In challenging configurations that have many more publishers (10k) than subscribers (1), the overall bandwidth reductions are more than 2x higher than that obtained by the state of the art.",
            "TLDR": "A new dictionary maintenance algorithm called PreDict is designed that adjusts its operation over time by adapting its parameters to the message stream and that amortizes the resulting compression-induced bandwidth overhead by enabling high compression ratios."

            "Abstract": "Novel trusted execution support, as offered by Intel's Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), embeds seamlessly into user space applications by establishing regions of encrypted memory, called enclaves. Enclaves comprise code and data that is executed under special protection of the CPU and can only be accessed via an enclave defined interface. To facilitate the usability of this new system abstraction, Intel offers a software development kit (SGX SDK). While the SDK eases the use of SGX, it misses appropriate programming support for inter-enclave interaction, and demands to hardcode the exact use of trusted execution into applications, which restricts flexibility. This paper proposes EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution -- especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves. EActors disentangles the interaction with enclaves and, among them, from costly execution mode transitions. It features lightweight fine-grained parallelism based on the concept of actors, thereby avoiding costly SGX SDK provided synchronisation constructs. Finally, EActors offers a high degree of freedom to execute actors, either untrusted or trusted, depending on security requirements and performance demands. We implemented two use cases on top of EActors: (i) a secure instant messaging service, and (ii) a secure multi-party computation service. Both illustrate the ability of EActors to seamlessly and effectively build secure applications. Furthermore, our performance evaluation results show that securing the messaging service with EActors improves performance compared to the vanilla versions of JabberD2 and ejabberd by up to 40x.",
            "TLDR": "EActors, an actor framework that is tailored to SGX and offers a more seamless, flexible and efficient use of trusted execution -- especially for applications demanding multiple enclaves, is proposed."

            "Abstract": "Novel trusted execution technologies such as Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) are considered a cure to many security risks in clouds. This is achieved by offering trusted execution contexts, so called enclaves, that enable confidentiality and integrity protection of code and data even from privileged software and physical attacks. To utilise this new abstraction, Intel offers a dedicated Software Development Kit (SDK). While it is already used to build numerous applications, understanding the performance implications of SGX and the offered programming support is still in its infancy. This inevitably leads to time-consuming trial-and-error testing and poses the risk of poor performance. To enable the development of well-performing SGX-based applications, this paper makes the following three contributions: First, it summarises identified performance critical factors of SGX. Second, it presents sgx-perf, a collection of tools for high-level dynamic performance analysis of SGX-based applications. In particular, sgx-perf performs not only fined-grained profiling of performance critical events in enclaves but also offers recommendations on how to improve enclave performance. Third, it demonstrates how we used sgx-perf in four non-trivial SGX workloads to increase their performance by up to 2.16x.",

            "Abstract": "Hardware Transactional Memory (HTM) has recently entered the realm of mainstream computing thanks to its integration in processors commercialized by major industrial manufacturers. HTM provides highly-efficient, hardware-assisted synchronization mechanisms for concurrent programs. Unfortunately, though, existing HTM implementations also suffer from severe limitations that are inherently related to their best-effort, hardware-based design. This work introduces SpRWL (Speculative Read Write Lock), a HTM-based implementation of read-write locks that provides a key benefit: allowing readers to execute outside the scope of hardware transactions, thus, effectively sparing them from any HTM-related limitation. SpRWL is the first HTM-based read-write lock implementation to support the concurrent execution of uninstrumented readers, while assuming a standard transaction demarcation API that is universally supported by any HTM implementation. Via an extensive experimental study, we show that SpRWL can achieve striking performance gains (up to 16x) with respect to state of the art read-write lock implementations based not only on pessimistic/lock-based schemes, but also on HTM-based techniques that exploit specific hardware mechanisms currently supported solely by a restricted number of architectures.",
            "TLDR": "SpRWL is the first HTM-based read-write lock implementation to support the concurrent execution of uninstrumented readers, while assuming a standard transaction demarcation API that is universally supported by any HTM implementation."

            "Abstract": "Fine-grained data provenance in data streaming allows linking each result tuple back to the source data that contributed to it, something beneficial for many applications (e.g., to find the conditions triggering a security- or safety-related alert). Further, when data transmission or storage has to be minimized, as in edge computing and cyber-physical systems, it can help in identifying the source data to be prioritized. The memory and processing costs of fine-grained data provenance, possibly afforded by high-end servers, can be prohibitive for the resource-constrained devices deployed in edge computing and cyber-physical systems. Motivated by this challenge, we present GeneaLog, a novel fine-grained data provenance technique for data streaming applications. Leveraging the logical dependencies of the data, GeneaLog takes advantage of cross-layer properties of the software stack and incurs a minimal, constant size per-tuple overhead. Furthermore, it allows for a modular and efficient algorithmic implementation using only standard data streaming operators. This is particularly useful for distributed streaming applications since the provenance processing can be executed at separate nodes, orthogonal to the data processing. We evaluate an implementation of GeneaLog using vehicular and smart grid applications, confirming it efficiently captures fine-grained provenance data with minimal overhead.",

            "Abstract": "To extract value from evergrowing volumes of data and to drive decision making, organizations frequently resort to the composition of data processing workflows. The typical workflow model enforces strict temporal synchronization across processing steps without accounting the actual effect of intermediate computations on the final workflow output. However, this is not the most desirable in a multitude of scenarios. We identify a class of applications for continuous data processing where the workflow output changes slowly and without great significance in a short time window, thus squandering compute resources with current approaches. To overcome such inefficiency, we introduce a novel workflow model, for continuous and data-intensive processing, capable of relaxing triggering semantics according to the impact that input data is assessed to have on changing the workflow output. To estimate this impact, learn the correlation between input and output variation, and guarantee correctness within a given tolerated error constant, we rely on Machine Learning. The functionality of this model is implemented in SmartFlux, a middleware framework which can be integrated with existing workflow managers. Experimental results indicate substantial savings in resource usage, while not deviating the workflow output beyond a small error constant with a high confidence level.",

            "Abstract": "Executing distributed machine learning (ML) jobs on Spark follows Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model, where parallel tasks execute the same iteration at the same time and the generated updates must be synchronized on parameters when all tasks are finished. However, the parallel tasks rarely have the same execution time due to sparse data so that the synchronization has to wait for tasks finished late. Moreover, running Spark on heterogeneous clusters makes it even worse because of stragglers, where the synchronization is significantly delayed by the slowest task. This paper attacks the fundamental BSP model that supports iterative ML jobs. We propose and develop a novel BSP-based Aggressive synchronization (A-BSP) model based on the convergent property of iterative ML algorithms, by allowing the algorithm to use the updates generated based on partial input data for synchronization. Specifically, when the fastest task completes, A-BSP fetches the current updates generated by the rest tasks that have partially processed their input data to push for aggressive synchronization. Furthermore, unprocessed data is prioritized for processing in the subsequent iterations to ensure algorithm convergence rate. Theoretically, we prove the algorithm convergence for gradient descent under A-BSP model. We have implemented A-BSP as a light-weight BSP-compatible mechanism in Spark and performed evaluations with various ML jobs. Experimental results show that compared to BSP, A-BSP speeds up the execution by up to 2.36x. We have also extended A-BSP onto Petuum platform and compared to the Stale Synchronous Parallel (SSP) and Asynchronous Synchronous Parallel (ASP) models. A-BSP performs better than SSP and ASP for gradient descent based jobs. It also outperforms SSP for jobs on physical heterogeneous clusters.",
            "TLDR": "A novel BSP-based Aggressive synchronization (A-BSP) model is proposed and developed based on the convergent property of iterative ML algorithms, by allowing the algorithm to use the updates generated based on partial input data for synchronization."

            "Abstract": "In this paper we introduce SpecRPC, a speculative execution framework that allows applications to concurrently execute dependent operations both locally and through remote procedure calls. The framework tracks dependencies among non-speculative and speculative operations and ensures that incorrect speculations do not affect the correctness of applications that follow our suggested design pattern. By using speculation to parallelize dependent operations, SpecRPC can significantly reduce application latency even if only a fraction of the results can be correctly speculated. We evaluate SpecRPC by using it to implement Replicated Commit, a low-latency distributed transaction commit protocol for geo-replicated database systems. Our evaluation results show that, compared to RPC frameworks that sequentially execute dependent operations, SpecRPC can reduce the average transaction completion time of Replicated Commit by 58%.",
            "TLDR": "This paper introduces SpecRPC, a speculative execution framework that allows applications to concurrently execute dependent operations both locally and through remote procedure calls and shows that it can significantly reduce application latency."

            "Abstract": "Real-time event detection and targeted decision making for emerging mission-critical applications, e.g. smart fire fighting, requires systems that extract and process relevant data from connected IoT devices in the environment. In this paper, we propose FireDeX, a cross-layer middleware that facilitates timely and effective exchange of data for coordinating emergency response activities. FireDeX adopts a publish-subscribe data exchange paradigm with brokers at the network edge to manage prioritized delivery of mission-critical data from IoT sources to relevant subscribers. It incorporates parameters at the application, network, and middleware layers into a data exchange service that accurately estimates end-to-end performance metrics (e.g. delays, success rates). We design an extensible queueing theoretic model that abstracts these cross-layer interactions as a network of queues, thereby making it amenable for rapid analysis. We propose novel algorithms that utilize results of this analysis to tune data exchange configurations (event priorities and dropping policies) while meeting situational awareness requirements and resource constraints. FireDeX leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) methodologies to enforce these configurations in the IoT network infrastructure. We evaluate its performance through simulated experiments in a smart building fire response scenario. Our results demonstrate significant improvement to mission-critical data delivery under a variety of conditions. Our application-aware prioritization algorithm improves the value of exchanged information by 36% when compared with no prioritization; the addition of our network-aware drop rate policies improves this performance by 42% over priorities only and by 94% over no prioritization.",

            "Abstract": "Attacks on the heap are an increasingly severe threat. State-of-the-art secure dynamic memory allocators can offer protection, however their memory footprint is high, making them suboptimal in many situations. We introduce Slim-Guard, a secure allocator whose design is driven by memory efficiency. Among other features, SlimGuard uses an efficient fine-grain size classes indexing mechanism and implements a novel dynamic canary scheme. It offers a low memory overhead due its size classes optimized for canary usage, its on-demand metadata allocation, and the combination of randomized allocations and over-provisioning into a single memory efficient security feature. SlimGuard protects against widespread heap-related attacks such as overflows, over-reads, double/invalid free, and use-after-free. Evaluation over a wide range of applications shows that it offers a significant reduction in memory consumption compared to the state-of-the-art secure allocator (up to 2x in macro-benchmarks), while offering similar or better security guarantees and good performance.",

            "Abstract": "With in-memory key-value caches such as Redis and Memcached being a key component for many systems to improve throughput and reduce latency, cloud caches have been widely adopted for small companies to deploy their own cache systems. However, data security is still a major concern, which affects the adoption of cloud caches. Tenant's data stored in a multi-tenant cloud environment faces threats from both co-located other tenants, as well as the untrusted cloud provider. We proposed EnclaveCache, which is a multi-tenant key-value cache that provides data confidentiality and privacy leveraging Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX). Enclave-Cache utilizes multiple SGX enclaves to enforce data isolation among co-located tenants. With a carefully designed key distribution procedure, EnclaveCache ensures that a tenant-specific encryption key is securely guarded by an enclave to perform cryptography operations towards tenant's data. Experimental results show that EnclaveCache achieves comparable performance to traditional key-value caches (with secure communication) with a performance overhead of 13% while ensuring security guarantees and better scalability.",
            "TLDR": "EnclaveCache is proposed, which is a multi-tenant key-value cache that provides data confidentiality and privacy leveraging Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX) and achieves comparable performance to traditional key- Value caches (with secure communication) with a performance overhead of 13% while ensuring security guarantees and better scalability."

            "Abstract": "Exploiting opportunistic memory by oversubscription is an appealing approach to improving cluster utilization and throughput. In this paper, we find the efficacy of memory oversubscription depends on whether or not the oversubscribed tasks can be killed by an OutOf Memory (OOM) killer in a timely manner to avoid significant memory thrashing upon memory pressure. However, current approaches in modern cluster schedulers are actually unable to unleash the power of opportunistic memory because their user space OOM killers are unable to timely deliver a task killing signal to terminate the oversubscribed tasks. Our experiments observe that a user space OOM killer fails to do that because of lacking the memory pressure knowledge from OS while the kernel space Linux OOM killer is too conservative to relieve memory pressure. In this paper, we design a user-assisted OOM killer (namely UA killer) in kernel space, an OS augmentation for accurate thrashing detection and agile task killing. To identify a thrashing task, UA killer features a novel mechanism, constraint thrashing. Upon UA killer, we develop Charon, a cluster scheduler for oversubscription of opportunistic memory in an on-demand manner. We implement Charon upon Mercury, a state-of-the-art opportunistic cluster scheduler. Extensive experiments with a Google trace in a 26-node cluster show that Charon can: (1) achieve agile task killing, (2) improve the best-effort job throughput by 3.5X over Mercury while prioritizing the production jobs, and (3) improve the 90th job completion time of production jobs over Kubernetes opportunistic scheduler by 62%.",
            "TLDR": "A user-assisted OOM killer in kernel space, an OS augmentation for accurate thrashing detection and agile task killing, and Charon, a cluster scheduler for oversubscription of opportunistic memory in an on-demand manner are designed."

            "Abstract": "Serverless computing is an emerging paradigm that greatly simplifies the usage of cloud resources and suits well to many tasks. Most notably, Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) enables programmers to develop cloud applications as individual functions that can run and scale independently. Yet, due to the disaggregation of storage and compute resources in FaaS, applications that require fine-grained support for mutable state and synchronization, such as machine learning and scientific computing, are hard to build. In this work, we present Crucial, a system to program highly-concurrent stateful applications with serverless architectures. Its programming model keeps the simplicity of FaaS and allows to port effortlessly multi-threaded algorithms to this new environment. Crucial is built upon the key insight that FaaS resembles to concurrent programming at the scale of a data center. As a consequence, a distributed shared memory layer is the right answer to the need for fine-grained state management and coordination in serverless. We validate our system with the help of micro-benchmarks and various applications. In particular, we implement two common machine learning algorithms: k-means clustering and logistic regression. For both cases, Crucial obtains superior or comparable performance to an equivalent Spark cluster.",

            "Abstract": "Despite extensive research on Byzantine Fault Tolerant (BFT) systems, overheads associated with such solutions preclude widespread adoption. Past efforts such as the Cross Fault Tolerance (XFT) model address this problem by making a weaker assumption that a majority of nodes are correct and communicate synchronously. Although XPaxos of Liu et al. (applying the XFT model) achieves similar performance as Paxos, it does not scale with the number of faults. Also, its reliance on a single leader introduces considerable downtime in case of failures. We present Elpis, the first multi-leader XFT consensus protocol. By adopting the Generalized Consensus specification, we were able to devise a multi-leader protocol that exploits the commutativity property inherent in the commands ordered by the system. Elpis maps accessed objects to non-faulty replicas during periods of synchrony. Subsequently, these replicas order all commands which access these objects. The experimental evaluation confirms the effectiveness of this approach: Elpis achieves up to 2x speedup over XPaxos and up to 3.5x speedup over state-of-the-art Byzantine Fault-Tolerant Consensus Protocols.",

            "Abstract": "Scaling data-structures up to the increasing number of cores provided by modern systems is challenging. The quest for scalability is complicated by the non-uniform memory accesses (NUMA) of multi-socket machines that often prohibit the effective use of data-structures that span memory localities. Conventional shared memory data-structures using efficient non-blocking or lock-based implementations inevitably suffer from cache-coherency overheads, and non-local memory accesses between sockets. Multi-socket systems are common in cloud hardware, and many products are pushing shared memory systems to greater scales, thus making the ability to scale data-structures all the more pressing. In this paper, we present the Distributed, Delegated Parallel Sections (DPS) runtime system that uses message-passing to move the computation on portions of data-structures between memory localities, while leveraging efficient shared memory implementations within each locality to harness efficient parallelism. We show through a series of data-structure scalability evaluations, and through an adaptation of memcached, that DPS enables strong data-structure scalability. DPS provides more than a factor of 3.1 improvements in throughput, and 23x decreases in tail latency for memcached.",

            "Abstract": "Deep learning (DL) is becoming increasingly popular in several application domains and has made several new application features involving computer vision, speech recognition and synthesis, self-driving automobiles, drug design, etc. feasible and accurate. As a result, large scale \"on-premise\" and \"cloud-hosted\" deep learning platforms have become essential infrastructure in many organizations. These systems accept, schedule, manage and execute DL training jobs at scale. This paper describes the design, implementation and our experiences with FfDL, a DL platform used at IBM. We describe how our design balances dependability with scalability, elasticity, flexibility and efficiency. We examine FfDL qualitatively through a retrospective look at the lessons learned from building, operating, and supporting FfDL; and quantitatively through a detailed empirical evaluation of FfDL, including the overheads introduced by the platform for various DL models, the load and performance observed in a real case study using FfDL within our organization, the frequency of various faults observed including faults that we did not anticipate, and experiments demonstrating the benefits of various scheduling policies. FfDL has been open-sourced.",

            "Abstract": "The large penetration and continued growth in ownership of personal electronic devices represents a freely available and largely untapped source of computing power. To leverage those, we present Pando, a new volunteer computing tool based on a declarative concurrent programming model and implemented using JavaScript, WebRTC, and WebSockets. This tool enables a dynamically varying number of failure-prone personal devices contributed by volunteers to parallelize the application of a function on a stream of values, by using the devices' browsers. We show that Pando can provide throughput improvements compared to a single personal device, on a variety of compute-bound applications including animation rendering and image processing. We also show the flexibility of our approach by deploying Pando on personal devices connected over a local network, on Grid5000, a French-wide computing grid in a virtual private network, and seven PlanetLab nodes distributed in a wide area network over Europe.",
            "TLDR": "It is shown that Pando can provide throughput improvements compared to a single personal device, on a variety of compute-bound applications including animation rendering and image processing, and the flexibility of the approach is shown by deploying Pando on personal devices connected over a local network."

            "Abstract": "With the increased adaption of blockchain technologies, permissioned blockchains such as Hyperledger Fabric provide a robust ecosystem for developing production-grade decentralized applications. However, the additional latency between executing and committing transactions, due to Fabric's three-phase transaction lifecycle of Execute-Order-Validate (EOV), is a potential scalability bottleneck. The added latency increases the probability of concurrent updates on the same keys by different transactions, leading to transaction failures caused by Fabric's concurrency control mechanism. The transaction failures increase the application development complexity and decrease Fabric's throughput. Conflict-free Replicated Datatypes (CRDTs) provide a solution for merging and resolving conflicts in the presence of concurrent updates. In this work, we introduce FabricCRDT, an approach for integrating CRDTs to Fabric. Our evaluations show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures.",
            "TLDR": "Elections show that in general, FabricCRDT offers higher throughput of successful transactions than Fabric, while successfully committing and merging all conflicting transactions without any failures, which is a good sign for scalability."

            "Abstract": "Remote computation has numerous use cases such as cloud computing, client-side web applications or volunteer computing. Typically, these computations are executed inside a sandboxed environment for two reasons: first, to isolate the execution in order to protect the host environment from unauthorised access, and second to control and restrict resource usage. Often, there is mutual distrust between entities providing the code and the ones executing it, owing to concerns over three potential problems: (i) loss of control over code and data by the providing entity, (ii) uncertainty of the integrity of the execution environment for customers, and (iii) a missing mutually trusted accounting of resource usage. In this paper we present AccTEE, a two-way sandbox that offers remote computation with resource accounting trusted by consumers and providers. AccTEE leverages two recent technologies: hardware-protected trusted execution environments, and Web-Assembly, a novel platform independent byte-code format. We show how AccTEE uses automated code instrumentation for fine-grained resource accounting while maintaining confidentiality and integrity of code and data. Our evaluation of AccTEE in three scenarios -- volunteer computing, serverless computing, and pay-by-computation for the web -- shows a maximum accounting overhead of 10%.",

            "Abstract": "With the increasing development of handheld devices, Location Based Services (LBSs) became very popular in facilitating users' daily life with a broad range of applications (e.g. traffic monitoring, geo-located search, geo-gaming). However, several studies have shown that the collected mobility data may reveal sensitive information about end-users such as their home and workplaces, their gender, political, religious or sexual preferences. To overcome these threats, many Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) were proposed in the literature. While the existing LPPMs try to protect most of the users in mobility datasets, there is usually a subset of users who are not protected by any of the existing LPPMs. By analogy to medical research, there are orphan diseases, for which the medical community is still looking for a remedy. In this paper, we present MooD, a fine-grained multi-LPPM user-centric solution whose main objective is to find a treatment to mobile users' orphan disease by protecting them from re-identification attacks. Our experiments are conducted on four real world datasets. The results show that MooD outperforms its competitors, and the amount of user mobility data it is able to protect is in the range between 97.5% to 100% on the various datasets.",
            "TLDR": "MooD is presented, a fine-grained multi-LPPM user-centric solution whose main objective is to find a treatment to mobile users' orphan disease by protecting them from re-identification attacks and the results show that MooD outperforms its competitors, and the amount of user mobility data it is able to protect is in the range between 97.5% to 100% on the various datasets."

            "Abstract": "Today, software operation engineers rely on application key performance indicators (KPIs) for sizing and orchestrating cloud resources dynamically. KPIs are monitored to assess the achievable performance and to configure various cloud-specific parameters such as flavors of instances and autoscaling rules, among others. Usually, keeping KPIs within acceptable levels requires application expertise which is expensive and can slow down the continuous delivery of software. Expertise is required because KPIs are normally based on application-specific quality-of-service metrics, like service response time and processing rate, instead of generic platform metrics, like those typical across various environments (e.g., CPU and memory utilization, I/O rate, etc.) In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of outsourcing the management of application performance from developers to cloud operators. In the same way that the serverless paradigm allows the execution environment to be fully managed by a third party, we discuss a monitorless model to streamline application deployment by delegating performance management. We show that training a machine learning model with platform-level data, collected from the execution of representative containerized services, allows inferring application KPI degradation. This is an opportunity to simplify operations as engineers can rely solely on platform metrics -- while still fulfilling application KPIs -- to configure portable and application agnostic rules and other cloud-specific parameters to automatically trigger actions such as autoscaling, instance migration, network slicing, etc. Results show that monitorless infers KPI degradation with an accuracy of 97% and, notably, it performs similarly to typical autoscaling solutions, even when autoscaling rules are optimally tuned with knowledge of the expected workload.",

            "Abstract": "Streaming applications exhibit abundant opportunities for pipeline parallelism, data parallelism and task parallelism. Prior work in IBM Streams introduced an elastic threading model that sought the best performance by automatically tuning the number of threads. In this paper, we introduce the ability to automatically discover where that threading model is profitable. However this introduces a new challenge: we have separate performance elastic mechanisms that are designed with different objectives, leading to potential negative interactions and unintended performance degradation. We present our experiences in overcoming these challenges by showing how to coordinate separate but interfering elasticity mechanisms to maxmize performance gains with stable and fast parallelism exploitation. We first describe an elastic performance mechanism that automatically adapts different threading models to different regions of an application. We then show a coherent ecosystem for coordinating this threading model elasticty with thread count elasticity. This system is an online, stable multi-level elastic coordination scheme that adapts different regions of a streaming application to different threading models and number of threads. We implemented this multi-level coordination scheme in IBM Streams and demonstrated that it (a) scales to over a hundred threads; (b) can improve performance by an order of magnitude on two different processor architectures when an application can benefit from multiple threading models; and (c) achieves performance comparable to hand-optimized applications but with much fewer threads.",

            "Abstract": "The demand for additional performance due to the rapid increase in the size and importance of data-intensive applications has considerably elevated the complexity of computer architecture. In response, systems offer pre-determined behaviors based on heuristics and then expose a large number of configuration parameters for operators to adjust them to their particular infrastructure. Unfortunately, in practice this leads to a substantial manual tuning effort. In this work, we focus on one of the most impactful tuning decisions in big data systems: the number of executor threads. We first show the impact of I/O contention on the runtime of workloads and a simple static solution to reduce the number of threads for I/O-bound phases. We then present a more elaborate solution in the form of self-adaptive executors which are able to continuously monitor the underlying system resources and detect contentions. This enables the executors to tune their thread pool size dynamically at runtime in order to achieve the best performance. Our experimental results show that being adaptive can significantly reduce the execution time especially in I/O intensive applications such as Terasort and PageRank which see a 34% and 54% reduction in runtime.",
            "TLDR": "This work presents a more elaborate solution in the form of self-adaptive executors which are able to continuously monitor the underlying system resources and detect contentions and enables the executors to tune their thread pool size dynamically at runtime in order to achieve the best performance."

            "Abstract": "Video on Demand (VoD) streaming is the largest source of Internet traffic. Efficient and scalable VoD requires Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) whose cost are prohibitive for many providers. An alternative is to cache and serve video content using end-users devices. Direct connections between these devices complement the resources of core VoD servers with an edge-assisted collaborative CDN. VoD access histories can reveal critical personal information, and centralized VoD solutions are notorious for exploiting personal data. Hiding the interests of users from servers and edge-assisting devices is necessary for a new generation of privacy-preserving VoD services. We introduce PrivaTube, a scalable and cost-effective VoD solution. PrivaTube aggregates video content from multiple servers and edge peers to offer a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for its users. It enables privacy preservation at all levels of the content distribution process. It leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) at servers and clients, and obfuscates access patterns using fake requests that reduce the risk of personal information leaks. Fake requests are further leveraged to implement proactive provisioning and improve QoE. Our evaluation of a complete prototype shows that PrivaTube reduces the load on servers and increases QoE while providing strong privacy guarantees.",
            "TLDR": "PrivaTube aggregates video content from multiple servers and edge peers to offer a high Quality of Experience (QoE) for its users, and leverages Trusted Execution Environments at servers and clients, and obfuscates access patterns using fake requests that reduce the risk of personal information leaks."

            "Abstract": "Today's big data clusters based on the MapReduce paradigm are capable of executing analysis jobs with multiple priorities, providing differential latency guarantees. Traces from production systems show that the latency advantage of high-priority jobs comes at the cost of severe latency degradation of low-priority jobs as well as daunting resource waste caused by repetitive eviction and re-execution of low-priority jobs. We advocate a new resource management design that exploits the idea of differential approximation and sprinting. The unique combination of approximation and sprinting avoids the eviction of low-priority jobs and its consequent latency degradation and resource waste. To this end, we designed, implemented and evaluated DiAS, an extension of the Spark processing engine to support deflate jobs by dropping tasks and to sprint jobs. Our experiments on scenarios with two and three priority classes indicate that DiAS achieves up to 90% and 60% latency reduction for low- and high-priority jobs, respectively. DiAS not only eliminates resource waste but also (surprisingly) lowers energy consumption up to 30% at only a marginal accuracy loss for low-priority jobs.",

            "Abstract": "Complex event processing systems process the input event streams on-the-fly. Since input event rate could overshoot the system's capabilities and results in violating a defined latency bound, load shedding is used to drop a portion of the input event streams. The crucial question here is how many and which events to drop so the defined latency bound is maintained and the degradation in the quality of results is minimized. In stream processing domain, different load shedding strategies have been proposed but they mainly depend on the importance of individual tuples (events). However, as complex event processing systems perform pattern detection, the importance of events is also influenced by other events in the same pattern. In this paper, we propose a load shedding framework called eSPICE for complex event processing systems. eSPICE depends on building a probabilistic model that learns about the importance of events in a window. The position of an event in a window and its type are used as features to build the model. Further, we provide algorithms to decide when to start dropping events and how many events to drop. Moreover, we extensively evaluate the performance of eSPICE on two real-world datasets.",

            "Abstract": "State machine replication (SMR) is a well-known approach to implementing fault-tolerant services, providing high availability and strong consistency. To boost the performance of SMR, some proposals execute independent commands concurrently, while dependent commands execute sequentially in the total delivery order. The most general approach to handling command dependencies resorts to a directed acyclic graph (DAG), where nodes represent commands and edges represent dependencies. In this paper we show that due to the command arrival and multithreaded execution rates of SMR, a highly concurrent implementation of a DAG is needed. We show that a typical coarse-grained DAG implementation, where the whole graph is a critical section, results in a bottleneck in the replica. We propose two improvements to the coarse-grained DAG approach: fine-grained algorithms, using lock-coupling, and lock-free algorithms. Our fine-grain algorithms lock individual vertices in the DAG. The lock-free algorithms use nonblocking synchronization, with atomic operations, and lazy synchronization to postpone physical removal of nodes. All algorithms were integrated in a parallel SMR prototype. Experimental evaluation revealed that the fine-grained algorithms are also subject to a bottleneck. The lock-free implementation, however, sports linear speedup with the number of working threads, in some cases scaling up to 64 threads.",

            "Abstract": "A long-standing promise of Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) replication is to maintain the service correctness despite the presence of malicious failures. The key challenge here is how to ensure replicas fail independently, i.e., avoid that a single attack compromises more than f replicas at once. The obvious answer for this is the use of diverse replicas, but most works in BFT simply assume such diversity without supporting mechanisms to substantiate this assumption. Lazarus is a control plane for managing the deployment and execution of diverse replicas in BFT systems. Lazarus continuously monitors the current vulnerabilities of the system replicas (reported in security feeds such as NVD and ExploitDB) and employs a metric to measure the risk of having a common weakness in the replicas set. If such risk is high, the set of replicas is reconfigured. Our evaluation shows that the devised strategy reduces the number of executions where the system becomes compromised and that our prototype supports the execution of full-fledged BFT systems in diverse configurations with 17 OS versions, reaching a performance close to a homogeneous bare-metal setup.",

With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, fog, and edge computing, SPAs are more often distributed on heterogeneous infrastructures, triggering the need for a holistic SPA-control that still considers heterogeneity. We therefore combine individual control mechanisms via the latency-distribution problem that seeks to distribute latency budgets to individually managed components of distributed SPAs for a lightweight yet effective end-to-end control. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical control architecture, give a formal definition of the latency-distribution problem, and provide both an ILP formulation to find an optimal solution as well as a heuristic approach, thereby enabling the combination of individual control mechanisms into one SPA while ensuring global cost minimality. Our evaluations show that both solutions are effective---while the heuristic approach is only slightly more costly than the optimal ILP solution, it significantly reduces runtime and communication overhead.",

            "Abstract": "System level provenance is of widespread interest for applications such as security enforcement and information protection. However, testing the correctness or completeness of provenance capture tools is challenging and currently done manually. In some cases there is not even a clear consensus about what behavior is correct. We present an automated tool, ProvMark, that uses an existing provenance system as a black box and reliably identifies the provenance graph structure recorded for a given activity, by a reduction to subgraph isomorphism problems handled by an external solver. ProvMark is a beginning step in the much needed area of testing and comparing the expressiveness of provenance systems. We demonstrate ProvMark's usefuless in comparing three capture systems with different architectures and distinct design philosophies.",

            "Abstract": "Approximate Query Processing has become increasingly popular as larger data sizes have increased query latency in distributed query processing systems. To provide such approximate results, systems return intermediate results and iteratively update these approximations as they process more data. In shared clusters, however, these systems waste resources by directing resources to queries that are no longer improving the results given to users. We describe ReLAQS, a cluster scheduling system for online aggregation queries that aims to reduce latency by assigning resources to queries with the most potential for improvement. ReLAQS utilizes the approximate results each query returns to periodically estimate how much progress each concurrent query is currently making. It then uses this information to predict how much progress each query is expected to make in the near future and redistributes resources in real-time to maximize the overall quality of the answers returned across the cluster. Experiments show that ReLAQS achieves a reduction in latency of up to 47% compared to traditional fair schedulers.",

            "Abstract": "Real-time event identification is critical in complex distributed infrastructures, e.g., water systems, where failures are difficult to isolate. We present AquaEIS, an event-based middleware tailored to the problem of locating sources of failure (e.g., contamination) in community water infrastructures. The inherent complexity of underground hydraulic systems combined with aging infrastructure presents unique challenges. AquaEIS combines online learning techniques, model-driven simulators and data from limited sensing networks to intelligently guide human participants (e.g., staff) in identifying contaminant sources. The framework integrates the necessary abstractions with event processing methods into a workflow that iteratively selects and refines the set of potential failure points for human-driven grab sampling. The integrated platform utilizes Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based representations along with field reports for event inference; reinforcement learning (RL) methods have also shown promise for further refining event locations and reducing the cost of human engagement. Our approach is evaluated in real-world water systems under a range of distinct events. The results show that AquaEIS can significantly reduce the number of sampling cycles, while ensuring localization accuracy (detected 100% of the failure events as compared to a baseline that can only identify 38% of the events).",

            "Abstract": "Production networks are transitioning from the use of physical middleboxes to virtual network functions (VNFs), which makes it easy to construct highly-customized service chains of VNFs dynamically using software. Wide-area service chains are increasingly important given the emergence of heterogeneous execution platforms consisting of customer premise equipment (CPE), small edge cloud sites, and large centralized cloud data centers, since only part of the service chain can be deployed at the CPE and even the closest edge site may not always be able to process all the customers' traffic. Switchboard is a middleware for realizing and managing such an ecosystem of diverse VNFs and cloud platforms. It exploits principles from service-oriented architectures to treat VNFs as independent services, and provides a traffic routing platform shared by all VNFs. Moreover, Switchboard's global controller optimizes wide-area routes based on a holistic view of customer traffic as well as the resources available at VNFs and the underlying network. Switchboard globally optimized routes achieve up to 57% higher throughput and 49% lower latency than a distributed load balancing approach in a wide-area testbed. Its routing platform supports line-rate traffic with millions of concurrent flows.",

            "Abstract": "Efficient and correct operation of an IoT network requires the presence of a failure detector and membership protocol amongst the IoT nodes. This paper presents a new failure detector for IoT settings where nodes are connected via a wireless ad-hoc network. This failure detector, which we name Medley, is fully decentralized, allows IoT nodes to maintain a local membership list of other alive nodes, detects failures quickly (and updates the membership list), and incurs low communication overhead in the underlying ad-hoc network. In order to minimize detection time and communication, we adapt a failure detector originally proposed for datacenters (SWIM), for the IoT environment. In Medley each node picks a medley of ping targets in a randomized and skewed manner, preferring nearer nodes. Via analysis and NS-3 simulation we show the right mix of pinging probabilities that simultaneously optimize detection time and communication traffic. We have also implemented Medley for Raspberry Pis, and present deployment results.",

            "Abstract": "Function-as-service (FaaS) platforms promise a simpler programming model for cloud computing, in which the developers concentrate on writing its applications. In contrast, platform providers take care of resource management and administration. As FaaS users are billed based on the execution of the functions, platform providers have a natural incentive not to keep idle resources running at the platform's expense. However, this strategy may lead to the cold start issue, in which the execution of a function is delayed because there is no ready resource to host the execution. Cold starts can take hundreds of milliseconds to seconds and have been a prohibitive and painful disadvantage for some applications. This work describes and evaluates a technique to start functions, which restores snapshots from previously executed function processes. We developed a prototype of this technique based on the CRIU process checkpoint/restore Linux tool. We evaluate this prototype by running experiments that compare its start-up time against the standard Unix process creation/start-up procedure. We analyze the following three functions: i) a \"do-nothing\" function, ii) an Image Resizer function, and iii) a function that renders Markdown files. The results attained indicate that the technique can improve the start-up time of function replicas by 40% (in the worst case of a \"do-nothing\" function) and up to 71% for the Image Resizer one. Further analysis indicates that the runtime initialization is a key factor, and we confirmed it by performing a sensitivity analysis based on synthetically generated functions of different code sizes. These experiments demonstrate that it is critical to decide when to create a snapshot of a function. When one creates the snapshots of warm functions, the speed-up achieved by the prebaking technique is even higher: the speed-up increases from 127.45% to 403.96%, for a small, synthetic function; and for a bigger, synthetic function, this ratio increases from 121.07% to 1932.49%.",
            "TLDR": "A technique to start functions, which restores snapshots from previously executed function processes, is developed based on the CRIU process checkpoint/restore Linux tool and results indicate that the technique can improve the start-up time of function replicas by 40% and up to 71% respectively."

            "Abstract": "Existing approaches to tolerate Byzantine faults in geo-replicated environments require systems to execute complex agreement protocols over wide-area links and consequently are often associated with high response times. In this paper we address this problem with Spider, a resilient replication architecture for geo-distributed systems that leverages the availability characteristics of today's public-cloud infrastructures to minimize complexity and reduce latency. Spider models a system as a collection of loosely coupled replica groups whose members are hosted in different cloud-provided fault domains (i.e., availability zones) of the same geographic region. This structural organization makes it possible to achieve low response times by placing replica groups in close proximity to clients while still enabling the replicas of a group to interact over short-distance links. To handle the inter-group communication necessary for strong consistency Spider uses a reliable group-to-group message channel with first-in-first-out semantics and built-in flow control that significantly simplifies system design.",
            "TLDR": "Spider is a resilient replication architecture for geo-distributed systems that leverages the availability characteristics of today's public-cloud infrastructures to minimize complexity and reduce latency."

            "Abstract": "We propose Knob, a practical active revocation scheme allowing to efficiently revoke users' access to encrypted data banks stored in public clouds. Knob leverages Trusted Execution Environments and All-or-Nothing Data Transforms in order to re-encrypt only small portions of the content directly in the cloud, using a scalable swarm of re-encryption workers. It prevents malicious users from being able to predict which portions of the files will be re-encrypted upon a revocation, effectively disabling pre-provisioning attacks. Our evaluation using industry workloads shows that Knob outperforms active revocation using full re-encryption by up to 3 orders of magnitude while being on average 3 to 7 times faster than state-of-the-art partial re-encryption.",

            "Abstract": "Data-driven intelligent applications in modern online services have become ubiquitous. These applications are usually hosted in the untrusted cloud computing infrastructure. This poses significant security risks since these applications rely on applying machine learning algorithms on large datasets which may contain private and sensitive information. To tackle this challenge, we designed secureTF, a distributed secure machine learning framework based on Tensorflow for the untrusted cloud infrastructure. secureTF is a generic platform to support unmodified TensorFlow applications, while providing end-to-end security for the input data, ML model, and application code. secureTF is built from ground-up based on the security properties provided by Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). However, it extends the trust of a volatile memory region (or secure enclave) provided by the single node TEE to secure a distributed infrastructure required for supporting unmodified stateful machine learning applications running in the cloud. The paper reports on our experiences about the system design choices and the system deployment in production use-cases. We conclude with the lessons learned based on the limitations of our commercially available platform, and discuss open research problems for the future work.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed overlay-based publish/subscribe systems provide a selective and scalable communication paradigm for connecting components of a distributed application. Existing overlay-based systems only guarantee delivery of notifications to clients that are already known by all brokers in the overlay. Nonetheless, due to the propagation delay, it takes time for a client's interests to be received by all brokers comprising the overlay. The message propagation delay and unclear delivery guarantees during this time increase the complexity of developing distributed applications based on the pub/sub paradigm. In this paper, we propose a collection of message processing and delivery guarantees that allows clients to clearly define the set of publications they receive. Based on our evaluation, these delivery guarantees can reduce buffering requirements on clients by up to 10 times, prevent missing notifications due to the propagation delay, and provide clients with primitive building blocks that simplify application development. We evaluate our proposed routing algorithms and show that a pub/sub system can provide the proposed delivery guarantees without increasing its resource requirements or hindering its throughput.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes a collection of message processing and delivery guarantees that allows clients to clearly define the set of publications they receive and evaluates the proposed routing algorithms and shows that a pub/sub system can provide the proposed delivery guarantees without increasing its resource requirements or hindering its throughput."

            "Abstract": "Matchmaking is a core enabling element in peer-to-peer markets. To date, matchmaking is predominantly performed by proprietary algorithms, fully controlled by market operators. This raises fairness concerns as market operators effectively can hide, prioritize, or delay the orders of specific users. Blockchain technology has been proposed as an alternative for fair matchmaking without a trusted operator but is still vulnerable to specific fairness attacks. We present MATCH, a decentralized middleware for fair matchmaking in peer-to-peer markets. By decoupling the dissemination of potential matches from the negotiation of trade agreements, MATCH empowers end-users to make their own educated decisions and to engage in direct negotiations with trade partners. This approach makes MATCH highly resilient against malicious matchmakers that deviate from a specific matching policy We implement MATCH and evaluate our middleware using real-world ride-hailing and asset trading workloads. It is demonstrated that MATCH maintains high matching quality, even when 75% of all matchmakers is malicious. We also show that the bandwidth usage and order fulfil latency of MATCH is orders of magnitude lower compared to matchmaking on an Ethereum blockchain.",

            "Abstract": "DNN learning jobs are common in today's clusters due to the advances in AI driven services such as machine translation and image recognition. The most critical phase of these jobs for model performance and learning cost is the tuning of hyperparameters. Existing approaches make use of techniques such as early stopping criteria to reduce the tuning impact on learning cost. However, these strategies do not consider the impact that certain hyperparameters and systems parameters have on training time. This paper presents PipeTune, a framework for DNN learning jobs that addresses the trade-offs between these two types of parameters. PipeTune takes advantage of the high parallelism and recurring characteristics of such jobs to minimize the learning cost via a pipelined simultaneous tuning of both hyper and system parameters. Our experimental evaluation using three different types of workloads indicates that PipeTune achieves up to 22.6% reduction and 1.7× speed up on tuning and training time, respectively. PipeTune not only improves performance but also lowers energy consumption up to 29%.",

We propose white-box algorithms to compute the strategies with small computing resource consumption in a short time. Recently, similar studies have been done to optimize device placement using reinforcement learning. Compared to those works which learn to optimize device placement of operations in several hours using large amounts of computing resources, our approach can find excellent device placement and execution order within minutes using the same computing node as for training. We design a list of scheduling algorithms to compute the device placement and execution order for each operation and also design an algorithm to split operations in the critical path to support fine-grained (mixed) data and model parallelism to further improve the training speed in each iteration. We compare FastT with representative strategies and obtain insights on the best strategies for training different types of DNN models based on extensive testbed experiments.",

            "Abstract": "Key-value stores such as LevelDB and RocksDB are widely used in various systems due to their high write performance. However, the background compaction operations inherent to the key-value stores are often to blame for write amplification and write stall. In particular, the SSTable size in the existing key-value stores introduces, upon compactions, a tradeoff between the fsync() call frequency and the amount of amplified writes. Small SSTables require a larger number of fsync()/fdatasync() than large SSTables to maintain file consistency. On the contrary, large SSTables result in large overlaps and frequent rewrites of SSTables. In this paper, to reduce file consistency overhead without increasing key ranges of SSTables, we present a variant of LSM-tree, namely, BoLT (Barrier-optimized LSM-Tree), that minimizes the number of calls to fsync()/fdatasync() barriers while taking advantage of fine-grained SSTables. BoLT consists of four key elements: (i) compaction file, (ii) logical SSTables, (iii) group compaction, and (iv) settled compaction. We implement BoLT in LevelDB and HyperLevelDB and compare the performances against LevelDB, HyperLevelDB, RocksDB, and the state-of-the-art PebblesDB. Our experimental study shows that BoLT achieves significantly higher write throughputs than LevelDB and HyperLevelDB.",

            "Abstract": "Multi-version concurrency control is a widely employed concurrency control mechanism, as it allows non-blocking accesses while providing isolation among transactions. However, maintaining multiple versions increases the latency for both point lookups and ranged retrievals because of the overhead in finding the right version. In particular, the append-only skip list---widely used in the state-of-the-art key-value stores (KVS)---shows a significant performance degradation due to its append-only nature. This paper presents a novel skip list implementation called JellyFish. JellyFish reduces the overhead of multi-version concurrency control by separating the per-key updates from the key indexing. We implement our design on top of RocksDB and compare it against a wide variety of data structures. Our evaluation with micro-benchmarks and real-world workloads show that we not only improve the throughput by up to 93%, but also reduce the latency of update operations by up to 42%.",

            "Abstract": "Software-defined wide area networking (SD-WAN) enables dynamic network policy control over a large distributed network via network updates. To be practical, network updates must be both consistent, i.e., free of transient errors caused by updates to multiple switches, and secure, i.e., free of errors caused by faulty or malicious members of the control plane. Besides, these properties must incur minimal overhead to controllers and switches. We present Cicero: a ConsIstent seCurE pRactical cOntroller for SD-WAN updates. Consistency is provided through a novel update scheduler in conjunction with a distributed transactional protocol while security is preserved by replicating the control plane and authenticating updates with an adaptive threshold cryptographic scheme. We ensure practicality by providing a mechanism for scalability through the definition of independent network domains and exploiting parallelism of network updates both within and across domains. Extensive experiments show Cicero imposes minimal switch burden and scales to large networks running multiple network applications all requiring concurrent network updates imposing at worst a 16% overhead on short-lived flow completion and negligible overhead on anticipated normal workloads.",

            "Abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is very appealing for its privacy benefits: essentially, a global model is trained with updates computed on mobile devices while keeping the data of users local. Standard FL infrastructures are however designed to have no energy or performance impact on mobile devices, and are therefore not suitable for applications that require frequent (online) model updates, such as news recommenders. This paper presents FLeet, the first Online FL system, acting as a middleware between the Android OS and the machine learning application. FLeet combines the privacy of Standard FL with the precision of online learning thanks to two core components: (i) I-Prof, a new lightweight profiler that predicts and controls the impact of learning tasks on mobile devices, and (ii) AdaSGD, a new adaptive learning algorithm that is resilient to delayed updates. Our extensive evaluation shows that Online FL, as implemented by FLeet, can deliver a 2.3× quality boost compared to Standard FL, while only consuming 0.036% of the battery per day. I-Prof can accurately control the impact of learning tasks by improving the prediction accuracy up to 3.6× (computation time) and up to 19× (energy). AdaSGD outperforms alternative FL approaches by 18.4% in terms of convergence speed on heterogeneous data.",

            "Abstract": "Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), such as Intel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX), are considered as a promising approach to resolve security challenges in clouds. TEEs protect the confidentiality and integrity of application code and data even against privileged attackers with root and physical access by providing an isolated secure memory area, i.e., enclaves. The security guarantees are provided by the CPU, thus even if system software is compromised, the attacker can never access the enclave's content. While this approach ensures strong security guarantees for applications, it also introduces a considerable runtime overhead in part by the limited availability of protected memory (enclave page cache). Currently, only a limited number of performance measurement tools for TEE-based applications exist and none offer performance monitoring and analysis during runtime. This paper presents TEEMon, the first continuous performance monitoring and analysis tool for TEE-based applications. TEEMon provides not only fine-grained performance metrics during runtime, but also assists the analysis of identifying causes of performance bottlenecks, e.g., excessive system calls. Our approach smoothly integrates with existing open-source tools (e.g., Prometheus or Grafana) towards a holistic monitoring solution, particularly optimized for systems deployed through Docker containers or Kubernetes and offers several dedicated metrics and visualizations. Our evaluation shows that TEEMon's overhead ranges from 5% to 17%.",

            "Abstract": "Existing approaches to distribute Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) either (i) fail to scale for they typically put the two components of a GAN (the generator and the discriminator) on different machines, inducing significant communication overhead, or (ii) they face GAN training specific issues, exacerbated by distribution. We propose FeGAN, the first middleware for distributing GANs over hundreds of devices addressing the issues of mode collapse and vanishing gradients. Essentially, we revisit the idea of Federated Learning, co-locating a generator with a discriminator on each device (addressing the scaling problem) and having a server aggregate the devices' models using balanced sampling and Kullback-Leibler (KL) weighting, mitigating training issues and boosting convergence. Through extensive experiments, we show that FeGAN generates high-quality dataset samples in a scalable and devices' heterogeneity tolerant manner. In particular, FeGAN achieves up to 5× throughput gain with 1.5× less bandwidth compared to the state-of-the-art GAN distributed approach (named MD-GAN), while scaling to at least one order of magnitude more devices. We demonstrate that FeGAN boosts training by 2.6× w.r.t. a baseline application of Federated Learning to GANs, while preventing training issues.",

            "Abstract": "Persistent memory allocator is an essential component of any Non-Volatile Main Memory (NVMM) application. A slow memory allocator can bottleneck the entire application stack, while an unsecure memory allocator can render applications inconsistent upon program bugs or system failure. Unlike DRAM-based memory allocators, it is indispensable for an NVMM allocator to guarantee its heap metadata safety from both internal and external errors. An effective NVMM memory allocator should be 1) safe, 2) scalable, and 3) high performing. Unfortunately, none of the existing persistent memory allocators achieve all three requisites. For example, we found that even Intel's de-facto NVMM allocator-libpmemobj is vulnerable to silent data corruption and persistent memory leaks resulting from a simple heap overflow. In this paper, we propose Poseidon, a safe, fast, and scalable persistent memory allocator. The premise of Poseidon revolves around providing a user application with per-CPU sub-heaps for scalability and high performance, while managing the heap metadata in a segregated fashion and efficiently protecting the metadata using a scalable hardware-based protection scheme, Intel's Memory Protection Keys (MPK). We evaluate Poseidon with a wide array of microbenchmarks and real-world benchmarks, noting: Poseidon outperforms the state-of-art allocators by a significant margin, showing improved scalability and performance, while also guaranteeing heap metadata protection.",
            "TLDR": "Poseidon is proposed, a safe, fast, and scalable persistent memory allocator that outperforms the state-of-art allocators by a significant margin, showing improved scalability and performance, while also guaranteeing heap metadata protection."

            "Abstract": "Adaptability is critical for stream processing systems to ensure stable, low-latency, and high-throughput processing of long-running queries. Such adaptability is particularly challenging for wide-area stream processing due to the highly dynamic nature of the wide-area environment, which includes unpredictable workload patterns, variable network bandwidth, occurrence of stragglers, and failures. Unfortunately, existing adaptation techniques typically achieve these performance goals by compromising the quality/accuracy of the results, and they are often application-dependent. In this work, we rethink the adaptability property of wide-area stream processing systems and propose a resource-aware adaptation framework, called WASP. WASP adapts queries through a combination of multiple techniques: task re-assignment, operator scaling, and query re-planning, and applies them in a WAN-aware manner. It is able to automatically determine which adaptation action to take depending on the type of queries, dynamics, and optimization goals. We have implemented a WASP prototype on Apache Flink. Experimental evaluation with the YSB benchmark and a real Twitter trace shows that WASP can handle various dynamics without compromising the quality of the results.",

            "Abstract": "Due to their lower startup latencies and finer-grain pricing than virtual machines (VMs), Amazon Lambdas and other cloud functions (CFs) have been identified as ideal candidates for handling unexpected spikes in simple, stateless workloads. However, it is not immediately clear if CFs would be similarly effective in autoscaling complex workloads involving significant state transfer across distributed application components. We have found that, through careful design, currently available CFs can indeed be useful even for complex workloads. To demonstrate this, we design and implement SplitServe, an enhancement of Apache Spark. If not enough executors on existing VMs are available for a newly arriving latency-sensitive job, SplitServe is able to use CFs to quickly bridge this shortfall in VMs, so avoiding the startup latencies of newly requested VMs. If desirable in terms of performance or cost, when newly requested VMs, or executors on existing VMs, do become available, SplitServe is able to move ongoing work from CFs to them. Our experimental evaluation of SplitServe using four different workloads (either on a mixture of VM-based executors and CFs or just CFs) shows that it improves execution time by up to (a) 55% for workloads with small to modest amount of shuffling, and (b) 31% in workloads with large amounts of shuffling, when compared to only VM-based autoscaling.",

            "Abstract": "Modern stream processing applications need to store and update state along with their processing, and process live data streams in a timely fashion from massive and geo-distributed data sets. Since they run in a dynamic distributed environment and their workloads may change in unexpected ways, multiple stream operators can fail at the same time, causing severe state loss. However, the state-of-the-art stream processing systems are mainly designed for low-latency intra-datacenter settings and do not scale well for running stream applications that contain large distributed states, suffering a significantly centralized bottleneck and high latency to recover state. They offer failure recovery mainly through three approaches: replication recovery, checkpointing recovery, and DStream-based lineage recovery, which are either slow, resource-expensive or fail to handle multiple simultaneous failures. We present SR3, a customizable state recovery framework that provides fast and scalable state recovery mechanisms for protecting large distributed states in stream processing systems. SR3 offers three recovery mechanisms --- the star-structured recovery, the line-structured recovery, and the tree-structured recovery --- to cater to the needs of different stream processing computation models, state sizes, and network settings. Our design adopts a decentralized architecture that partitions and replicates states by using consistent ring overlays that leverage distributed hash tables (DHTs). We show that this approach can significantly improve the scalability and flexibility of state recovery. We realize the SR3 design on a prototype integrated with the widely adopted Apache Storm framework. Large-scale experiments using real-world datasets demonstrate SR3's scalability, fast recovery, and flexibility properties.",

            "Abstract": "Emerging IoT applications with real-time latency constraints require new data processing systems operating at the Edge. Serverless computing offers a new compelling paradigm, where a user can execute a small application without handling the operational issues of server provisioning and resource management. Despite a variety of existing commercial and open source serverless platforms (utilizing VMs and containers), these solutions are too heavy-weight for a resource-constrained Edge systems (due to large memory footprint and high invocation time). Moreover, serverless workloads that focus on per-client, short-running computations are not an ideal fit for existing general purpose computing systems. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Sledge -- a novel and efficient WebAssembly-based serverless framework for the Edge. Sledge is optimized for supporting unique properties of serverless workloads: the need for high density multi-tenancy, low startup time, bursty client request rates, and short-lived computations. Sledge is designed for these constraints by offering (i) optimized scheduling policies and efficient work-distribution for short-lived computations, and (ii) a light-weight function isolation model implemented using our own WebAssembly-based software fault isolation infrastructure. These lightweight sandboxes are designed to support high-density computation: with fast startup and teardown times to handle high client request rates. An extensive evaluation of Sledge with varying workloads and real-world serverless applications demonstrates the effectiveness of the designed serverless-first runtime for the Edge. Sledge supports up to 4 times higher throughput and 4 times lower latencies compared to Nuclio, one of the fastest open-source serverless frameworks.",

            "Abstract": "Datacenters are witnessing a rapid surge in the adoption of serverless functions for microservices-based applications. A vast majority of these microservices typically span less than a second, have strict SLO requirements, and are chained together as per the requirements of an application. The aforementioned characteristics introduce a new set of challenges, especially in terms of container provisioning and management, as the state-of-the-art resource management frameworks, employed in serverless platforms, tend to look at microservice-based applications similar to conventional monolithic applications. Hence, these frameworks suffer from microservice agnostic scheduling and colossal container over-provisioning, especially during workload fluctuations, thereby resulting in poor resource utilization. In this work, we quantify the above shortcomings using a variety of workloads on a multi-node cluster managed by the Kubernetes and Brigade serverless framework. To address them, we propose Fifer --- an adaptive resource management framework to efficiently manage function-chains on serverless platforms. The key idea is to make Fifer (i) utilization conscious by efficiently bin packing jobs to fewer containers using function-aware container scaling and intelligent request batching, and (ii) at the same time, SLO-compliant by proactively spawning containers to avoid cold-starts, thus minimizing the overall response latency. Combining these benefits, Fifer improves container utilization and cluster-wide energy consumption by 4× and 31%, respectively, without compromising on SLO's, when compared to the state-of-the-art schedulers employed by serverless platforms.",

            "Abstract": "Decentralised cloud computing platforms enable individuals to offer and rent resources in a peer-to-peer fashion. They must assign resources from multiple sellers to multiple buyers and derive prices that match the interests and capacities of both parties. The assignment process must be decentralised, fair and transparent, but also protect the privacy of buyers. We present PASTRAMI, a decentralised platform enabling trustworthy assignments of items and prices between a large number of sellers and bidders, through the support of multi-item auctions. PASTRAMI uses threshold blind signatures and commitment schemes to provide strong privacy guarantees while making bidders accountable. It leverages the Ethereum blockchain for auditability, combining efficient off-chain computations with novel, on-chain proofs of misbehaviour. Our evaluation of PASTRAMI using Filecoin workloads show its ability to efficiently produce trustworthy assignments between thousands of buyers and sellers.",

            "Abstract": "Trusted computing defines how to securely measure, store, and verify the integrity of software controlling a computer. One of the major challenge that make them hard to be applied in practice is the issue with software updates. Specifically, an operating system update causes the integrity violation because it changes the well-known initial state trusted by remote verifiers, such as integrity monitoring systems. Consequently, the integrity monitoring of remote computers becomes unreliable due to the high amount of false positives. We address this problem by adding an extra level of indirection between the operating system and software repositories. We propose a trusted software repository (TSR), a secure proxy that overcomes the shortcomings of previous approaches by sanitizing software packages. Sanitization consists of modifying unsafe installation scripts and adding digital signatures in a way software packages can be installed in the operating system without violating its integrity. TSR leverages shielded execution, i.e., Intel SGX, to achieve confidentiality and integrity guarantees of the sanitization process. TSR is transparent to package managers, and requires no changes in the software packages building and distributing processes. Our evaluation shows that running TSR inside SGX is practical; since it induces only ~ 1.18× performance overhead during package sanitization compared to the native execution without SGX. TSR supports 99.76% of packages available in the main and community repositories of Alpine Linux while increasing the total repository size by 3.6%.",

            "Abstract": "Intel SGX is already here, with a strong emphasis on security and privacy. However, it is not free. Studies have shown that it incurs a significant performance overhead to take advantage of the security and privacy enhancement offered by SGX. In particular, it only provides limited physical memory for applications to use SGX. As a result, page faults can be frequently triggered during program execution, especially for memory-intensive applications with a large memory footprint. Therefore, it is imperative to look into possible optimization opportunities to enhance the efficiency of SGX. To this end, this paper proposes to leverage memory page preloading techniques to mitigate such a problem. More specifically, we propose two effective schemes to preload memory pages before they are accessed. This way, the number of page faults can be significantly reduced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes, we have implemented them in a prototype using LLVM and an untrusted operating system. Experimental results on benchmarks from SPEC CPU2017 and a micro-benchmark program show that, on average, these two mechanisms can achieve 11.4% and 7.0% performance improvement with a maximum performance improvement of 18.6% and 9.0%, respectively. The two mechanisms are also evaluated when they are deployed together. The combined approach can achieve an improvement of 7.1% on some real-world applications such as SIFT and MSER.",

            "Abstract": "Data deduplication as an important middleware plays an essential role in current backup systems due to the high space efficiency, which however suffers from low restore performance, since the chunks are heavily fragmented. Existing systems leverage caching and rewriting schemes to reduce the number of container reads to restore the original data. However, when storing a large number of versions, the caching schemes become inefficient since each cached container consists of a few required chunks due to the exacerbated fragmentation, while the rewriting schemes consume more space to store the duplicate chunks. In this paper, we explore and exploit the behaviors of the fragmented chunks in the backup systems. Based on the observations, we propose the open-sourced HiDeStore1, a High-performance Deduplication and reStore backup system without decreasing the deduplication ratio. The main insight is to enhance the physical locality for the new backup versions during the deduplication process. Thus, the chunks are stored closely and the number of container reads significantly decreases to restore the original data. Compared with state-of-the-art deduplication and restore schemes, HiDeStore reduces the index lookup overhead by 38% and improves the restore performance by up to 1.6x, without decreasing the deduplication ratio.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes the open-sourced HiDeStore1, a High-performance Deduplication and reStore backup system without decreasing the deduplication ratio, to enhance the physical locality for the new backup versions during the dedUplication process."

            "Abstract": "Organization of tasks as workflows are an essential feature to expand the applicability of the serverless computing framework. Existing serverless platforms are either agnostic to function chains (workflows as a composition of functions) or rely on naive provisioning and management mechanisms of the serverless framework---an example is that they provision resources after the trigger to each function in a workflow arrives thereby forcing a setup latency for each function in the workflow. In this work, we focus on mitigating the cascading cold start problem--- the latency overheads in triggering a sequence of serverless functions according to a workflow specification. We first establish the nature and extent of the cascading effects in cold start situations across multiple commercial server platforms and cloud providers. Towards mitigating these cascading overheads, we design and develop several optimizations, that are built into our tool Xanadu. Xanadu offers multiple instantiation options based on the desired runtime isolation requirements and supports function chaining with or without explicit workflow specifications. Xanadu's optimizations to address the cascading cold start problem are built on speculative and just-in-time provisioning of resources. Our evaluation of the Xanadu system reveals almost complete elimination of cascading cold starts at minimal cost overheads, outperforming the available state of the art platforms. For even relatively short workflows, Xanadu reduces platform overheads by almost 18x compared to Knative and 10x compared to Apache Openwhisk.",

            "Abstract": "Feeding external data to a blockchain, a.k.a. data feed, is an essential task to enable blockchain interoperability and support emerging cross-domain applications. Given the data-intensive nature of real-life feeds (e.g., high-frequency price updates) and the high cost of using blockchain, namely Gas, it is imperative to reduce the Gas cost of data feeds. Motivated by the constant-changing workloads in financial applications, this work aims at designing a dynamic, workload-aware approach for Gas cost optimization. This design space is understudied in existing blockchain research which has so far focused on static data placement. This work presents GRuB, a cost-effective data feed that dynamically replicates data between the blockchain and off-chain cloud storage. GRuB monitors the current workload and makes data-replication decisions in a workload-adaptive fashion. Online algorithms are proposed to bound the worstcase cost in Gas. GRuB's decision-making components run on the untrusted cloud off-chain for lower Gas, and employs a security protocol to authenticate the data transferred between the blockchain and cloud. We built a GRuB prototype on Ethereum and supported real financial applications. Using the workloads reconstructed from Ethereum transaction history, we evaluate GRuB's cost and show a Gas saving by 10% ~ 74%, in comparison with the static baselines.",

            "Abstract": "Decentralized algorithms, e.g., AllReduce, have been widely applied as the synchronization strategy for data-parallel distributed deep learning due to its superior performance over centralized ones. The synchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) approach guarantees accuracy for various deep learning models, but its performance suffers from stragglers, i.e., \"long-tail effects.\" The straggler can be caused by the inherent load imbalance from workloads or system heterogeneity. Despite existing optimizations to support centralized algorithms against stragglers, little effort has been explored in decentralized training algorithms. This paper proposes a Randomized Non-blocking AllReduce (RNA) protocol to mitigate the straggler problem. To avoid \"long-tail effects\" brought by the strict barrier in the AllReduce, we propose a decentralized, relaxed, and randomized sampling approach to implement partial AllReduce operation. To handle heterogeneity at a large scale, we combine the traditional Parameter Servers (PS) with AllReduce to implement a hierarchical synchronization mechanism. We theoretically demonstrate the convergence analysis and detail the system implementation. The experiment results on representative deep learning models show nearly 1.8× speedup over the state-of-the-art Horovod and 1.3× speedup over AD-PSGD on a heterogeneous cluster.",

            "Abstract": "We present a distributed system architecture which is scalable by design for cross-camera vehicle tracking at video ingestion time dubbed Coral-Pie. To meet the latency bounds for timely processing of every frame at each camera, we associate dedicated low-cost computational resource for each camera, which consists of two Raspberry Pi 3B+'s and one Coral Accelerator (EdgeTpu). The end-to-end system generates and stores the tracks in a graph database for easy querying. We use the Cloud-Edge-Device continuum to appropriately place the components of the distributed system architecture. Using the timing profiles of the sub-tasks involved in the continuous processing that needs to happen on every frame in each camera, we map the elements of the processing onto the computational resource associated with each camera. Performance evaluation of the proof-of-concept system is conducted using live streams from five campus cameras. The evaluation includes microbenchmarks as well as application level studies. The controlled experiments using live cameras are augmented with a simulation-based study to show the self-healing property of the system and the system scalability.",

Because of this, work distribution decisions must take into account both relative compute performance of asymmetric CPUs and communication overheads. libHetMP drives workload distribution decisions without programmer intervention by measuring performance characteristics during cross-node execution. A novel HetProbe loop iteration scheduler decides if cross-node execution is beneficial, and either distributes work according to the relative performance of CPUs when it is, or places all work on the set of homogeneous CPUs providing the best performance when it is not. We evaluate libHetMP using compute kernels from several OpenMP benchmark suites and show a geometric mean 41% speedup in execution time across asymmetric CPUs.",

            "Abstract": "The broad adoption of fanout queries on distributed datastores has made asynchronous event-driven datastore drivers a natural choice due to reduced multithreading overhead. However, through extensive experiments using the latest datastore drivers (e.g., MongoDB, HBase, DynamoDB) and YCSB benchmark, we show that an asynchronous datastore driver can cause unexpected performance degradation especially in fanout-query scenarios. For example, the default MongoDB asynchronous driver adopts the latest Java asynchronous I/O library, which uses a hidden on-demand JVM level thread pool to process fanout query responses, causing a surprising multithreading overhead when the query response size is large. A second instance is the traditional wisdom of modular design of an application server and the embedded asynchronous datastore driver can cause an im-balanced workload between the two components due to lack of coordination, incurring frequent unnecessary system calls. To address the revealed problems, we introduce DoubleFaceAD--a new asynchronous datastore driver architecture that integrates the management of both upstream and downstream workload traffic through a few shared reactor threads, with fanout-query-aware priority-based scheduling to reduce the overall query waiting time. Our experimental results on two representative application scenarios (YCSB and DBLP) show DoubleFaceAD outperforms all other types of datastore drivers up to 34% on throughput and 1.9× faster on 99th percentile response time.",

            "Abstract": "As offered by the Intel Software Guard Extensions (SGX), trusted execution enables confidentiality and integrity for off-site deployed services. Thereby, securing key-value stores has received particular attention, as they are a building block for many complex applications to speed-up request processing. Initially, the developers' main design challenge has been to address the performance barriers of SGX. Besides, we identified the integration of a SGX-secured key-value store with recent network technologies, especially RDMA, as an essential emerging requirement. RDMA allows fast direct access to remote memory at high bandwidth. As SGX-protected memory cannot be directly accessed over the network, a fast exchange between the main and trusted memory must be enabled. More importantly, SGX-protected services can be expected to be CPU-bound as a result of the vast number of cryptographic operations required to transfer and store data securely. In this paper, we present Precursor, a new key-value store design that utilizes trusted execution to offer confidentiality and integrity while relying on RDMA for low latency and high bandwidth communication. Precursor offloads cryptographic operations to the client-side to prevent a server-side CPU bottleneck and reduces data movement in and out of the trusted execution environment. Our evaluation shows that Precursor achieves up to 6--8.5 times higher throughput when compared against similar SGX-secured key-value store approaches.",
            "TLDR": "Precursor is presented, a new key-value store design that utilizes trusted execution to offer confidentiality and integrity while relying on RDMA for low latency and high bandwidth communication."

PProx does not impact recommendations accuracy, is compatible with arbitrary recommendation algorithms, and has minimal deployment requirements. Its design combines two proxying layers directly running inside SGX enclaves at the RaaS provider side. These layers transparently pseudonymize users and items and hide links between the two, and PProx privacy guarantees are robust even to the corruption of one of these enclaves. We integrated PProx with Harness's Universal Recommender and evaluated it on a 27-node cluster. Our results indicate its ability to withstand a high number of requests with low end-to-end latency, horizontally scaling up to match increasing workloads of recommendations.",

FW-KV's primary goal is to allow its read-only transactions to access more up-to-date (fresher) versions of objects than Walter, the state-of-the-art implementation of PSI. FW-KV achieves that without assuming synchrony or a synchronized clock service. The improved level of freshness comes at no significant performance degradation, especially in low contention workloads, as assessed by our evaluation study including two standard OLTP benchmarks, YCSB and TPC-C. The performance gap between FW-KV and Walter is less than 5% in low contention scenarios, and less than 28% in high contention.",

            "Abstract": "The increasing size of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has necessitated the use of multiple GPUs to host a single DNN model, a practice commonly referred to as model parallelism. The key challenge for model parallelism is to efficiently and effectively partition the DNN model across GPUs to avoid communication overheads while maximizing the GPU utilization, with the end-goal of minimizing the training time of DNN models. Existing approaches either take a long time(hours or even days) to find an effective partition or settle for sub-optimal partitioning, invariably increasing the end-to-end training effort. In this paper, we design and implement Pesto, a fast and near-optimal model placement technique for automatically partitioning arbitrary DNNs across multiple GPUs. The key idea in Pesto is to jointly optimize the model placement and scheduling at the fine-grained operation level to minimize inter-GPU communication while maximizing the opportunity to parallelize the model across GPUs. By carefully formulating the problem as an integer program, Pesto can provide the optimal placement and scheduling. We implement Pesto in TensorFlow and show that Pesto can reduce model training time by up to 31% compared to state-of-the-art approaches, across several large DNN models.",

            "Abstract": "Current leader-based Byzantine fault-tolerant (BFT) protocols aim to improve the efficiency for achieving consensus while tolerating failures; however, Byzantine servers are able to repeatedly impair BFT systems as faulty servers launch attacks without costs. In this paper, leveraging Proof-of-Work and Raft, we propose a new BFT consensus protocol called Prosecutor that dynamically penalizes suspected faulty behavior and suppresses Byzantine servers over time. Prosecutor obstructs Byzantine servers from being elected in leader election by imposing hash computation on new election campaigns. Furthermore, Prosecutor applies message authentication to achieve secure log replication and maintains a similar message-passing scheme as Raft. The evaluation results show that the penalization mechanism progressively suppresses and marginalizes Byzantine servers if they repeatedly launch malicious attacks.",
            "TLDR": "A new BFT consensus protocol called Prosecutor is proposed that dynamically penalizes suspected faulty behavior and suppresses Byzantine servers over time and applies message authentication to achieve secure log replication and maintains a similar message-passing scheme as Raft."

However, the quickly moving technology hinders reproducibility, and the lack of a standardized benchmarking suite leads to ad-hoc solutions and microbenchmarks being used in serverless research, further complicating meta-analysis and comparison of research solutions. To address this challenge, we propose the Serverless Benchmark Suite: the first benchmark for FaaS computing that systematically covers a wide spectrum of cloud resources and applications. Our benchmark consists of the specification of representative workloads, the accompanying implementation and evaluation infrastructure, and the evaluation methodology that facilitates reproducibility and enables interpretability. We demonstrate that the abstract model of a FaaS execution environment ensures the applicability of our benchmark to multiple commercial providers such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. Our work facilities experimental evaluation of serverless systems, and delivers a standardized, reliable and evolving evaluation methodology of performance, efficiency, scalability and reliability of middleware FaaS platforms.",

            "Abstract": "Microservices-based video analytics pipelines routinely use multiple deep convolutional neural networks. We observe that the best allocation of resources to deep learning engines (or microservices) in a pipeline, and the best configuration of parameters for each engine vary over time, often at a timescale of minutes or even seconds based on the dynamic content in the video. We leverage these observations to develop Magic-Pipe, a self-optimizing video analytic pipeline that leverages AI techniques to periodically self-optimize. First, we propose a new, adaptive resource allocation technique to dynamically balance the resource usage of different microservices, based on dynamic video content. Then, we propose an adaptive microservice parameter tuning technique to balance the accuracy and performance of a microservice, also based on video content. Finally, we propose two different approaches to reduce unnecessary computations due to unavoidable mismatch of independently designed, re-usable deep-learning engines: a deep learning approach to improve the feature extractor performance by filtering inputs for which no features can be extracted, and a low-overhead graph-theoretic approach to minimize redundant computations across frames. Our evaluation of Magic-Pipe shows that pipelines augmented with self-optimizing capability exhibit application response times that are an order of magnitude better than the original pipelines, while using the same hardware resources, and achieving similar high accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Trusted execution as offered by Intel's Software Guard Extensions (SGX) is considered as an enabler to protect the integrity and confidentiality of stateful workloads such as key-value stores and databases in untrusted environments. These systems are typically long running and require extension mechanisms built on top of dynamic loading as well as hot-patching to avoid downtimes and apply security updates faster. However, such essential mechanisms are currently neglected or even missing in combination with trusted execution. We present sgx-dl, a lean framework that enables dynamic loading of enclave code at the function level and hot-patching of dynamically loaded code. Additionally, sgx-dl is the first framework to utilize the new SGX version 2 features and also provides a versioning mechanism for dynamically loaded code. Our evaluation shows that sgx-dl introduces a performance overhead of less than 5% and shrinks application downtime by an order of magnitude in the case of a database system.",
            "TLDR": "This work presents sgx-dl, a lean framework that enables dynamic loading of enclave code at the function level and hot-patching of dynamically loaded code and is the first framework to utilize the new SGX version 2 features and also provides a versioning mechanism for dynamicallyloaded code."

            "Abstract": "Datacenter servers are increasingly heterogeneous: from x86 host CPUs, to ARM or RISC-V CPUs in NICs/SSDs, to FPGAs. Previous works have demonstrated that migrating application execution at run-time across heterogeneous-ISA CPUs can yield significant performance and energy gains, with relatively little programmer effort. However, FPGAs have often been overlooked in that context: hardware acceleration using FPGAs involves statically implementing select application functions, which prohibits dynamic and transparent migration. We present Xar-Trek, a new compiler and run-time software framework that overcomes this limitation. Xar-Trek compiles an application for several CPU ISAs and select application functions for acceleration on an FPGA, allowing execution migration between heterogeneous-ISA CPUs and FPGAs at run-time. Xar-Trek's run-time monitors server workloads and migrates application functions to an FPGA or to heterogeneous-ISA CPUs based on a scheduling policy. We develop a heuristic policy that uses application workload profiles to make scheduling decisions. Our evaluations conducted on a system with x86-64 server CPUs, ARM64 server CPUs, and an Alveo accelerator card reveal 88%-l% performance gains over no-migration baselines.",

            "Abstract": "Adaptive Replacement Cache (ARC) is a state-of-the-art cache replacement policy with a constant-time complexity per request. It uses a recency list and a frequency list to balance between access recency and access frequency. In this paper, we re-examine the ARC policy and demonstrate its weaknesses: 1) some entries in the recency list are not recent; and 2) the constraint of the recency list length limits the capability in identifying weak locality. We then propose a new policy, Shadow ARC (SHARC), to overcome those weaknesses with shadow recency cache management. In SHARC, we track the virtual time of the accesses. We allow the shadow recency cache to grow on demand, but proactively identify unpromising entries for eviction based on a comprehensive eviction criterion. While the criterion is calculated from the virtual time, we provide the theoretical justification that in scenarios of strong locality, it tightly bounds the recency distance of the entries. In scenarios of relatively weak locality, the criterion dynamically determines the size of the shadow recency cache based on the activeness of the frequency cache items and the promotion activities of the recency items. Experimental results indicate that SHARC outperforms the state-of-the-art policies of ARC, Low Inter-Reference Recency Set (LIRS), and Dynamic LIRS.",

            "Abstract": "Containers are a mainstream virtualization technique commonly used to run stateful workloads over persistent storage. In multi-tenant hosts with high utilization, resource contention at the system kernel often leads to inefficient handling of the container I/O. Assuming a distributed storage architecture for scalability, resource sharing is particularly problematic at the client hosts serving the applications of competing tenants. Although increasing the scalability of a system kernel can improve resource efficiency, it is highly challenging to refactor the kernel for fair access to system services. As a realistic alternative, we isolate the storage I/O paths of different tenants by serving them with distinct clients running at user level. We introduce the Danaus client architecture to let each tenant access the container root and application filesystems over a private host path. We developed a Danaus prototype that integrates a union filesystem with a Ceph distributed filesystem client and a configurable shared cache. Across different host configurations, workloads and systems, Danaus achieves improved performance stability because it handles I/O with reserved per-tenant resources and avoids intensive kernel locking. Danaus offers up to 14.4x higher throughput than a popular kernel-based client under conditions of I/O contention. In comparison to a FUSE-based user-level client, Danaus also reduces by 14.2x the time to start 256 high-performance webservers. Based on our extensive experience from building and evaluating Danaus, we share several valuable lessons that we learned about resource contention, file management, service separation and performance stability.",
            "TLDR": "This work developed a Danaus prototype that integrates a union filesystem with a Ceph distributed filesystem client and a configurable shared cache and achieves improved performance stability because it handles I/O with reserved per-tenant resources and avoids intensive kernel locking."

            "Abstract": "Accelerators, such as GPU, are a scarce resource in deep learning (DL). Effectively and efficiently sharing GPU leads to improved hardware utilization as well as user experiences, who may need to wait for hours to access GPU before a long training job is done. Spatial and temporal multitasking on GPU have been studied in the literature, but popular deep learning frameworks, such as Tensor-Flow and PyTorch, lack the support of GPU sharing among multiple DL models, which are typically represented as computation graphs, heavily optimized by underlying DL libraries, and run on a complex pipeline spanning CPU and GPU. Our study shows that GPU kernels, spawned from computation graphs, can barely execute simultaneously on a single GPU and time slicing may lead to low GPU utilization. This paper presents SwitchFlow, a scheduling framework for DL multitasking. It centers on two designs. First, instead of scheduling a computation graph as a whole, SwitchFlow schedules its subgraphs and prevents subgraphs from different models to run simultaneously on a GPU. This results in less interference and the elimination of out-of-memory errors. Moreover, subgraphs running on different devices can overlap with each other, leading to a more efficient execution pipeline. Second, SwitchFlow maintains multiple versions of each subgraph. This allows subgraphs to be migrated across devices at a low cost, thereby enabling low-latency preemption. Results on representative DL models show that SwitchFlow achieves up to an order of magnitude lower tail latency for inference requests collocated with a training job.",
            "TLDR": "SwitchFlow is presented, a scheduling framework for DL multitasking that achieves up to an order of magnitude lower tail latency for inference requests collocated with a training job and maintains multiple versions of each subgraph, thereby enabling low-latency preemption."

            "Abstract": "In this paper we study mechanisms that permit to augment the FaaS middleware with support for Transactional Causal Consistency (TCC). At first glance, it may seem that offering TCC to FaaS applications can trivially be achieved, given that the FaaS paadigm does not prevent applications from selecting the storage service with the properties they need. Unfortunately, most TCC storage services ensure consistency only to individual client processes, while a FaaS application is executed by multiple, independent, worker processes. Therefore, there is the need to coordinate the workers, a task that can be a significant source of overhead. We propose a novel architecture to support TCC in FaaS, named FaaSTCC, that significantly reduces the coordination overhead. FaaSTCC achieves this goal by augmenting the workers with a caching layer and by implementing novel mechanisms that maximize the cache usage. First, our storage layer offers to the caching layer a promise, that sets a horizon where the versions retrieved by the cache are guaranteed to be consistent. Second, in FaaSTCC, functions coordinate using snapshot intervals, that support the lazy identification of the read snapshot, increasing the chances of using the cached values. We have implemented and experimentally evaluated FaaSTCC. Our results show that FaaSTCC achieves up to 5x lower average latency and 6x lower tail latency than previous work.",
            "TLDR": "A novel architecture to support TCC in FaaS, named FaaSTCC, is proposed that significantly reduces the coordination overhead and achieves up to 5x lower average latency and 6x lower tail latency than previous work."

            "Abstract": "Atomic multicast is a group communication abstraction useful in the design of highly available and scalable systems. It allows messages to be addressed to a subset of the processes in the system reliably and consistently. Many atomic multicast algorithms have been designed for the message-passing system model. The paper presents RamCast, the first atomic multicast protocol for the shared-memory system model. We design RamCast by leveraging Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) technology and by carefully combining techniques from message-passing and shared-memory systems. We show experimentally that RamCast outperforms current state-of-the-art atomic multicast protocols, increasing throughput by up to 3.7x and reducing latency by up to 28x.",

            "Abstract": "Co-location and memory sharing between latency-critical services, such as key-value store and web search, and best-effort batch jobs is an appealing approach to improving memory utilization in multi-tenant datacenter systems. However, we find that the very diverse goals of job co-location and the GNU/Linux system stack can lead to severe performance degradation of latency-critical services under memory pressure in a multi-tenant system. We address memory pressure for latency-critical services via fast memory allocation and proactive reclamation. We find that memory allocation latency dominates the overall query latency, especially under memory pressure. We analyze the default memory management mechanism provided by GNU/Linux system stack and identify the reasons why it is inefficient for latency-critical services in a multi-tenant system. We present Hermes, a fast memory allocation mechanism in user space that adaptively reserves memory for latency-critical services. It advises Linux OS to proactively reclaim memory of batch jobs. We implement Hermes in GNU C Library. Experimental result shows that Hermes reduces the average and the 99th percentile memory allocation latency by up to 54.4% and 62.4% for a micro benchmark, respectively. For two real-world latency-critical services, Hermes reduces both the average and the 99th percentile tail query latency by up to 40.3%. Compared to the default Glibc, jemalloc and TCMalloc, Hermes reduces Service Level Objective violation by up to 84.3% under memory pressure.",
            "TLDR": "Her Hermes, a fast memory allocation mechanism in user space that adaptively reserves memory for latency-critical services, is presented and Linux OS is advised to proactively reclaim memory of batch jobs."

            "Abstract": "Gossip-based consensus protocols have been recently proposed to confront the challenges faced by state machine replication in large geographically distributed systems. It is unclear, however, to which extent consensus and gossip communication fit together. On the one hand, gossip communication has been shown to scale to large settings and efficiently handle participant failures and message losses. On the other hand, gossip may slow down consensus. Moreover, gossip's inherent redundancy may be unnecessary since consensus naturally accounts for participant failures and message losses. This paper investigates the suitability of gossip as a communication building block for consensus. We answer three questions: How much overhead does classic gossip introduce in consensus? Can we design consensus-friendly gossip protocols? Would more efficient gossip protocols still maintain the same reliability properties of classic gossip?",

            "Abstract": "Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) has raised a growing interest in how to \"tame\" serverless to enable domain-specific use cases such as data-intensive applications and machine learning (ML), to name a few. Recently, several systems have been implemented for training ML models. Certainly, these research articles are significant steps in the correct direction. However, they do not completely answer the nagging question of when serverless ML training can be more cost-effective compared to traditional \"serverful\" computing. To help in this task, we propose MLLess, a FaaS-based ML training prototype built atop IBM Cloud Functions. To boost cost-efficiency, MLLess implements two key optimizations: a significance filter and a scale-in auto-tuner, and leverages them to specialize model training to the FaaS model. Our results certify that MLLess can be 15X faster than serverful ML systems [24] at a lower cost for ML models (such as sparse logistic regression and matrix factorization) that exhibit fast convergence.",

            "Abstract": "Tracing and analyzing the interactions and exchanges between nodes is fundamental to uncover performance, correctness and dependability issues almost unavoidable in any complex distributed system. Existing monitoring tools acknowledge this importance but, so far, restrict tracing to the external attributes of I/O messages, thus missing a wealth of information in them. We present CaT, a non-intrusive content-aware tracing and analysis framework that, through a novel similarity-based approach, is able to comprehensively trace and correlate the flow of network and storage requests from applications. By supporting multiple tracing tools, CaT can balance the coverage of captured events with the impact on applications' performance. The conducted experimental evaluation considering two widely used applications (TensorFlow and Apache Hadoop) shows how CaT can improve the analysis of distributed systems. The results also exemplify the trade-offs that can be used to balance tracing coverage and performance impact. Interestingly, in certain cases, full coverage of events can be attained with negligible performance and storage overhead.",

These storage systems encode files using Merkle trees, a hierarchical data structure that provides integrity verification and lookup services. A Merkle tree maps the chunks of a file to a single root whose hash value is the file's content-address. A major concern is that even minor network churn can result in chunks becoming irretrievable due to the hierarchical dependencies in the Merkle tree. For example, chunks may be available but can not be found if all peers storing the root fail. Thus, to reduce the impact of churn, a decentralized replication process typically stores each chunk at multiple peers. However, we observe that this process reduces the network's storage utilization and is vulnerable to cascading failures as some chunks are replicated 10X less than others. We propose Snarl, a novel storage component that uses a variation of alpha entanglement codes to add user-controlled redundancy to address these problems. Our contributions are summarized as follows: 1) the design of an entangled Merkle tree, a resilient data structure that reduces the impact of hierarchical dependencies, and 2) the Snarl prototype to improve file availability and storage utilization in a real-world storage network. We evaluate Snarl using various failure scenarios on a large cluster running the Ethereum Swarm network. Our evaluation shows that Snarl increases storage utilization by 5X in Swarm with improved file availability. File recovery is bandwidth-efficient and uses less than 2X chunks on average in scenarios with up to 50% of total chunk loss.",
            "TLDR": "The design of an entangled Merkle tree, a resilient data structure that reduces the impact of hierarchical dependencies, and the Snarl prototype to improve file availability and storage utilization in a real-world storage network are summarized."

            "Abstract": "Serverless functions are an emerging cloud computing paradigm that is being rapidly adopted by both industry and academia. In this cloud computing model, the provider opaquely handles resource management tasks such as resource provisioning, deployment, and auto-scaling. The only resource management task that developers are still in charge of is selecting how much resources are allocated to each worker instance. However, selecting the optimal size of serverless functions is quite challenging, so developers often neglect it despite its significant cost and performance benefits. Existing approaches aiming to automate serverless functions resource sizing require dedicated performance tests, which are time-consuming to implement and maintain. In this paper, we introduce an approach to predict the optimal resource size of a serverless function using monitoring data from a single resource size. As our approach does not require dedicated performance tests, it enables cloud providers to implement resource sizing on a platform level and automate the last resource management task associated with serverless functions. We evaluate our approach on four different serverless applications on AWS, where it predicts the execution time of the other memory sizes based on monitoring data for a single memory size with an average prediction error of 15.3%. Based on these predictions, it selects the optimal memory size for 79.0% of the serverless functions and the second-best memory size for 12.3% of the serverless functions, which results in an average speedup of 39.7% while also decreasing average costs by 2.6%.",

            "Abstract": "Depending on energy sources and demand, the carbon intensity of the public power grid fluctuates over time. Exploiting this variability is an important factor in reducing the emissions caused by data centers. However, regional differences in the availability of low-carbon energy sources make it hard to provide general best practices for when to consume electricity. Moreover, existing research in this domain focuses mostly on carbon-aware workload migration across geo-distributed data centers, or addresses demand response purely from the perspective of power grid stability and costs. In this paper, we examine the potential impact of shifting computational workloads towards times where the energy supply is expected to be less carbon-intensive. To this end, we identify characteristics of delay-tolerant workloads and analyze the potential for temporal workload shifting in Germany, Great Britain, France, and California over the year 2020. Furthermore, we experimentally evaluate two workload shifting scenarios in a simulation to investigate the influence of time constraints, scheduling strategies, and the accuracy of carbon intensity forecasts. To accelerate research in the domain of carbon-aware computing and to support the evaluation of novel scheduling algorithms, our simulation framework and datasets are publicly available.",
            "TLDR": "This paper identifies characteristics of delay-tolerant workloads and analyzes the potential for temporal workload shifting in Germany, Great Britain, France, and California over the year 2020 to examine the potential impact of shifting computational workloads towards times where the energy supply is expected to be less carbon-intensive."

            "Abstract": "Modern IT systems rely heavily on log analytics for critical operational tasks. Since the volume of logs produced from numerous distributed components is overwhelming, it requires us to employ automated processing. The first step of automated log processing is to convert streams of log lines into the sequence of log format IDs, called log templates. A log template serves as a base string with unfilled parts from which logs are generated during runtime by substitution of contextual information. The problem of log template discovery from the volume of collected logs poses a great challenge due to the semi-structured nature of the logs and the computational overheads. Our investigation reveals that existing techniques show various limitations. We approach the log template discovery problem as search-based learning by applying the ILP (Inductive Logic Programming) framework. The algorithm core consists of narrowing down the logs into smaller sets by analyzing value compositions on selected log column positions. Our evaluation shows that it produces accurate log templates from diverse application logs with small computational costs compared to existing methods. With the quality metric we defined, we obtained about 21%-51% improvements of log template quality.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a privacy preserving event based UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) transaction system. Unlike the existing approaches that often depend on smart contracts where digital assets are first locked in a vault, and then released according to event triggers, the event based transaction system encodes event outcome as part of the UTXO note and safeguards event privacy by shielding it with zero-knowledge proof based protocols such that associations between UTXO notes and events are hidden from the validators. Without relying on any triggering mechanism, the proposed transaction system separates event processing from the transaction processing where confidential event based UTXO notes (event based UTXOs or conditional UTXOs) can be transferred freely with full privacy in an asynchronous manner, only with their asset values conditional to the linked event outcomes. The main advantage of such design is that it enables free trade of event based digital assets and prevents the assets from being locked. We implemented the proposed transaction system by extending the Zerocoin data model and protocols. The system is implemented and evaluated using xJsnark.",

            "Abstract": "Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) heterogeneous platforms provide immense computational power, but are difficult to program and to correctly use when real-time requirements come into play: A sound configuration of the operating system scheduler is needed, and a suitable mapping of tasks to computing units must be determined. Flawed designs lead to sub-optimal system configurations and, thus, to wasted resources or even to deadline misses and system failures. We propose YASMIN, a middleware to schedule end-user applications with real-time requirements in user space and on behalf of the operating system. YASMIN combines an easy-to-use programming interface with portability across a wide range of architectures. It treats heterogeneity on COTS embedded platforms as a first-class citizen: YASMIN supports multiple functionally equivalent task implementations with distinct extra-functional behaviour. This enables the system designer to quickly explore different scheduling policies and task-to-core mappings, and thus, to improve overall system performance. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of YASMIN and provide an analysis of the scheduling overhead on an Odroid-XU4 platform. We demonstrate the merits of YASMIN on an industrial use-case involving a search-and-rescue drone.",

            "Abstract": "Federated learning allows a group of distributed clients to train a common machine learning model on private data. The exchange of model updates is managed either by a central entity or in a decentralized way, e.g. by a blockchain. However, the strong generalization across all clients makes these approaches unsuited for non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) data. We propose a unified approach to decentralization and personalization in federated learning that is based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of model updates. Instead of training a single global model, clients specialize on their local data while using the model updates from other clients dependent on the similarity of their respective data. This specialization implicitly emerges from the DAG-based communication and selection of model updates. Thus, we enable the evolution of specialized models, which focus on a subset of the data and therefore cover non-IID data better than federated learning in a centralized or blockchain-based setup. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed solution is the first to unite personalization and poisoning robustness in fully decentralized federated learning. Our evaluation shows that the specialization of models emerges directly from the DAG-based communication of model updates on three different datasets. Furthermore, we show stable model accuracy and less variance across clients when compared to federated averaging.",

            "Abstract": "With the ever-increasing pervasiveness of the cloud computing paradigm, strong isolation guarantees and low performance overhead from isolation platforms are paramount. An ideal isolation platform offers both: an impermeable isolation boundary while imposing a negligible performance overhead. In this paper, we examine various isolation platforms (containers, secure containers, hypervisors, unikernels), and conduct a wide array of experiments to measure the performance overhead and degree of isolation offered by the platforms. We find that container platforms have the best, near-native, performance while the newly emerging secure containers suffer from various overheads. The highest degree of isolation is achieved by unikernels, closely followed by traditional containers.",
            "TLDR": "It is found that container platforms have the best, near-native, performance while the newly emerging secure containers suffer from various overheads."

            "Abstract": "Edge applications, such as gaming, cooperative engineering, or in-the-field information sharing, enjoy immediate response, autonomy and availability by distributing and replicating data at the edge. However, application developers and users demand the highest possible consistency guarantees, and specific support for group collaboration. To address this challenge, Colony guarantees Transactional Causal Plus Consistency (TCC+) globally, strengthened to Snapshot Isolation within edge groups. To help with scalability, fault tolerance and security, its logical communication topology is forest-like, with replicated roots in the core cloud, but with the flexibility to migrate a node or a group. Despite this hybrid approach, applications enjoy the same semantics everywhere in the topology. Our experiments show that local caching and peer groups improve throughput and response time significantly, performance is not affected in offline mode, and that migration is seamless.",

            "Abstract": "The popularity of the Java programming language has led to its wide adoption in cloud computing infrastructures. However, Java applications running in untrusted clouds are vulnerable to various forms of privileged attacks. The emergence of trusted execution environments (TEEs) such as Intel SGX mitigates this problem. TEEs protect code and data in secure enclaves inaccessible to untrusted software, including the kernel and hypervisors. To efficiently use TEEs, developers must manually partition their applications into trusted and untrusted parts, in order to reduce the size of the trusted computing base (TCB) and minimise the risks of security vulnerabilities. However, partitioning applications poses two important challenges: (i) ensuring efficient object communication between the partitioned components, and (ii) ensuring the consistency of garbage collection between the parts, especially with memory-managed languages such as Java. We present Montsalvat, a tool which provides a practical and intuitive annotation-based partitioning approach for Java applications destined for secure enclaves. Montsalvat provides an RMI-like mechanism to ensure inter-object communication, as well as consistent garbage collection across the partitioned components. We implement Montsalvat with GraalVM native-image, a tool for compiling Java applications ahead-of-time into standalone native executables that do not require a JVM at runtime. Our extensive evaluation with micro- and macro-benchmarks shows our partitioning approach to boost performance in real-world applications up to 6.6x (PalDB) and 2.2x (GraphChi) as compared to solutions that naively include the entire applications in the enclave.",
            "TLDR": "Montsalvat provides an RMI-like mechanism to ensure inter-object communication, as well as consistent garbage collection across the partitioned components, and is implemented with GraalVM native-image, a tool for compiling Java applications ahead-of-time into standalone native executables that do not require a JVM at runtime."

            "Abstract": "Data streaming applications in Cyber-Physical Systems enable high-throughput, low-latency transformations of raw data into value. The performance of such applications, run by Stream Processing Engines (SPEs), can be boosted through custom CPU scheduling. Previous schedulers in the literature require alterations to SPEs to control the scheduling through user-level threads. While such alterations allow for fine-grained control, they hinder the adoption of such schedulers due to the high implementation cost and potential limitations in application semantics (e.g., blocking I/O). Motivated by the above, we explore the feasibility and benefits of custom scheduling without alterations to SPEs but, instead, by orchestrating the OS scheduler (e.g., using nice and cgroup) to enforce the scheduling goals. We propose Lachesis, a standalone scheduling middleware, decoupled from any specific SPE, that can schedule multiple streaming applications, run in one or many nodes, and possibly multiple SPEs. Our evaluation with real-world and synthetic workloads, several SPEs and hardware setups, shows its benefits over default OS scheduling and other state-of-the-art schedulers: up to 75% higher throughput, and 1130x lower average latency once such SPEs reach their peak processing capacity.",
            "TLDR": "Lachesis is proposed, a standalone scheduling middleware, decoupled from any specific SPE, that can schedule multiple streaming applications, run in one or many nodes, and possibly multiple SPEs, by orchestrating the OS scheduler to enforce the scheduling goals."

            "Abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated impressive performance on many machine-learning tasks such as image recognition and language modeling, and are becoming prevalent even on mobile platforms. Despite so, designing neural architectures still remains a manual, time-consuming process that requires profound domain knowledge. Recently, Parameter Tuning Servers have gathered the attention o industry and academia. Those systems allow users from all domains to automatically achieve the desired model accuracy for their applications. However, although the entire process of tuning and training models is performed solely to be deployed for inference, state-of-the-art approaches typically ignore system-oriented and inference-related objectives such as runtime, memory usage, and power consumption. This is a challenging problem: besides adding one more dimension to an already complex problem, the information about edge devices available to the user is rarely known or complete. To accommodate all these objectives together, it is crucial for tuning system to take a holistic approach to parameter tuning and consider all levels of parameters simultaneously into account. We present EdgeTune, a novel inference-aware parameter tuning server. It considers the tuning of parameters in all levels backed by an optimization function capturing multiple objectives. Our approach relies on inference estimated metrics collected from our emulation server running asynchronously from the main tuning process. The latter can then leverage the inference performance while still tuning the model. We propose a novel one-fold tuning algorithm that employs the principle of multi-fidelity and simultaneously explores multiple tuning budgets, which the prior art can only handle as suboptimal case of single type of budget. EdgeTune outputs inference recommendations to the user while improving tuning time and energy by at least 18\\% and 53\\% when compared to the baseline.",
            "TLDR": "A novel one-fold tuning algorithm that employs the principle of multi-fidelity and simultaneously explores multiple tuning budgets, which the prior art can only handle as suboptimal case of single type of budget is proposed."

            "Abstract": "As more and more mobile/embedded applications employ Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) involving sensitive user data, mobile/embedded devices must provide a highly secure DNN execution environment to prevent privacy leaks. Aimed at securing DNN data, recent studies execute part of a DNN in a trusted execution environment (e.g., TrustZone) to isolate DNN execution from the other processes; however, as the trusted execution environments for mobile/embedded devices provide limited memory protection, DNN data remain unencrypted in DRAM and become vulnerable to physical attacks. The devices can prevent the physical attacks by keeping DNN data encrypted in DRAM; when DNN data get referenced during DNN execution, they get loaded to the SRAM and get decrypted by a CPU core. Unfortunately, using the SRAM with demand paging greatly increases DNN execution time due to the inefficient use of the SRAM and the high CPU consumption of data encryption/decryption. In this paper, we present GuardiaNN, a fast and secure DNN framework which greatly accelerates DNN execution without sacrificing security guarantees. To accelerate secure DNN execution, GuardiaNN first reduces slow DRAM accesses with direct convolutions and maximizes the reuse of SRAM-stored data with DNN-friendly SRAM management. Then, aimed at dedicating the limited CPU resources to DNN execution, GuardiaNN offloads DNN data encryption/decryption onto secure cryptographic hardware and employs pipelining to overlap DNN execution with the encryption/decryption. For eight DNNs chosen from five representative mobile/embedded application domains, our implementation of GuardiaNN on STM32MP157C-DK2 development board achieves a geomean speedup of 15.3x and a geomean energy efficiency improvement of 15.2x over a baseline secure DNN framework which employs demand-paged SRAM to secure sensitive data.",
            "TLDR": "GuardiaNN is presented, a fast and secure DNN framework which greatly accelerates DNN execution without sacrificing security guarantees and reduces slow DRAM accesses with direct convolutions and maximizes the reuse of SRAM-stored data with DNN-friendly SRAM management."

            "Abstract": "Modern software programs have dedicated license-check modules that restrict access to users, who possess valid credentials. They also have a large number of add-on pluggable modules that can be separately purchased and have their dedicated license managers. Sadly, recent work shows that regardless of their complexity, it is possible to break their security using a novel class of attacks known as control flow bending attacks (CFB attacks), where the program is run on a virtual CPU, unbeknownst to it. In this paper, we propose SecureLease -- a novel approach that efficiently solves this problem by running the license managers and other parts of the application in a trusted execution environment (TEE) (hardware managed sandbox). Since it is not enough to just move the license managers to the TEE because they can be circumvented using CFB attacks, we need to further handicap the attacker by also moving key parts of the application to the TEE subject to various runtime and software engineering constraints. Hence, we propose a novel application partitioning algorithm that is far superior to the state of the art scheme. Furthermore, we propose an extremely fine-grained yet scalable license management and license distribution scheme. The key insight is that we avoid remote calls and intelligently use some degree of local caching. Hence, our license validation phase is $66.34\\%$ faster than the nearest competing work.",

            "Abstract": "For resource utilization efficiency, latency critical (LC) services are commonly co-located with best-effort batch jobs in datacenter servers. Many LC services, such as Cassandra and HBase, run in Java Virtual Machine (JVM). We find that LC services often experience heavy-tailed latency due to performance interference of the concurrent garbage collection (GC) as well as multi-tenancy. The root cause is a semantic gap of resource allocation between JVM and the underlying Linux OS in multi-tenant systems. That is, the OS is unaware of the characteristics of different kinds of threads in JVM (i.e., GC threads and LC worker threads), which may lead to GC threads competing for CPUs; JVM is unaware of the resource utilization in the OS, which may trigger CPU-intensive GC operations when CPUs are busy. Furthermore, we find that co-located batch jobs can interfere with LC services due to Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT). We propose iGC, a middleware that bridges the semantic gap between JVM and Linux OS and improves concurrent GC performance in multi-tenant systems. iGC adaptively triggers GC based on the CPU utilization at runtime, which speeds up the GC process and reduces its CPU contention. Furthermore, iGC deploys a dynamic CPU scheduling and thread placement strategy to avoid or mitigate the interference due to concurrent GC and multi-tenancy, but also improve the cache performance. We implement iGC upon two state-of-the-art concurrent GC mechanisms ZGC and G1 GC. We conduct its evaluation using three NoSQL databases as LC services. Experimental results show that iGC significantly improves the performance of concurrent GC for LC services and the throughput in multi-tenant systems. iGC reduces the p95 tail latency by 83%, 37% and 22% for the three LC services Cassandra, HBase and Solr, respectively. It also increases the throughput of LC services up to 2.56X.",
            "TLDR": "iGC, a middleware that bridges the semantic gap between JVM and Linux OS and improves concurrent GC performance in multi-tenant systems is proposed and Experimental results show that iGC significantly improves the performance of concurrent GC for LC services and the throughput inMulti-Tenant systems."

            "Abstract": "Byzantine fault-tolerant agreement (BFT) in a partially synchronous system usually requires 3f + 1 nodes to tolerate f faulty replicas. Due to their high throughput and finality property, BFT algorithms build the core of recent permissioned blockchains. As a complex and resource-demanding infrastructure, multiple cloud providers have started offering Blockchain-as-a-Service. This eases the deployment of permissioned blockchains but places the cloud provider in a central controlling position, thereby questioning blockchains' fault tolerance and decentralization properties and their underlying BFT algorithm. This paper presents SplitBFT, a new way to utilize trusted execution technology (TEEs), such as Intel SGX, to harden the safety and confidentiality guarantees of BFT systems, thereby strengthening the trust in could-based deployments of permissioned blockchains. Deviating from standard assumptions, SplitBFT acknowledges that code protected by trusted execution may fail. We address this by splitting and isolating the core logic of BFT protocols into multiple compartments resulting in a more resilient architecture. We apply SplitBFT to the traditional practical byzantine fault tolerance algorithm (PBFT) and evaluate it using SGX. Our results show that SplitBFT adds only a reasonable overhead compared to the non-compartmentalized variant.",

            "Abstract": "As private space companies such as SpaceX and Telesat are building large LEO satellite constellations to provide global broadband Internet access, researchers have proposed to embed compute services within satellite constellations to provide computing services on the *LEO edge*. While the LEO edge is merely theoretical at the moment, providers are expected to rapidly develop their satellite technologies to keep the upper hand in the new space race. In this paper, we answer the question of how researchers can explore the possibilities of LEO edge computing and evaluate arbitrary software systems in an accurate runtime environment and with cost-efficient scalability. To that end, we present Celestial, a virtual testbed for the LEO edge based on microVMs. Celestial can efficiently emulate individual satellites and their movement as well as ground station servers with realistic network conditions and in an application-agnostic manner, which we show empirically. Additionally, we explore opportunities and implications of deploying a real-time remote sensing application on LEO edge infrastructure in a case study on Celestial.",
            "TLDR": "Celestial, a virtual testbed for the LEO edge based on microVMs, is presented and can efficiently emulate individual satellites and their movement as well as ground station servers with realistic network conditions and in an application-agnostic manner, which it shows empirically."

            "Abstract": "In recent years, ROS becomes the dominant middleware for robotic systems. The performance of its message-passing paradigm is crucial to the robot's reaction time. However, previous works only focus on efficiency, but ignore the requirement for transparency. We present ROS-SF framework, which can transparently eliminate serialization and de-serialization under the ROS APIs. The key contributions are a new serialization format called SFM and a life-cycle management method for serialization-free messages. Evaluation results show that our ROS-SF framework can improve the message-passing performance of ROS by up to 76.3\\%. Application case study and applicability study show that our ROS-SF framework can be transparently applied to many existing ROS-based systems and packages. Even in the failure cases, our ROS-SF framework can provide modification guidance.",

            "Abstract": "Random forests use ensembles of decision trees to boost accuracy for machine learning tasks. However, large ensembles slow down inference on platforms that process each tree in an ensemble individually. We present Bolt, a platform that restructures whole random forests, not just individual trees, to speed up inference. Conceptually, Bolt maps every path in each tree to a lookup table which, if cache were large enough, would allow inference with just one memory access. When the size of the lookup table exceeds cache capacity, Bolt employs a novel combination of lossless compression, parameter selection, and bloom filters to shrink the table while preserving fast inference. We compared inference speed in Bolt to three state-of-the-art platforms: Python Scikit-Learn, Ranger, and Forest Packing. We evaluated these platforms using datasets with vision, natural language processing and categorical applications. We observed that on ensembles of shallow decision trees Bolt can run 2--14X faster than competing platforms and that Bolt's speedups persist as the number of decision trees in an ensemble increases.",
            "TLDR": "Bolt is a platform that restructures whole random forests, not just individual trees, to speed up inference and can run 2--14X faster on ensembles of shallow decision trees than competing platforms and that Bolt's speedups persist as the number of decision trees in an ensemble increases."

            "Abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is a popular deep learning approach that prevents centralizing large amounts of data, and instead relies on clients that update a global model using their local datasets. Classical FL algorithms use a central federator that, for each training round, waits for all clients to send their model updates before aggregating them. In practical deployments, clients might have different computing powers and network capabilities, which might lead slow clients to become performance bottlenecks. Previous works have suggested to use a deadline for each learning round so that the federator ignores the late updates of slow clients, or so that clients send partially trained models before the deadline. To speed up the training process, we instead propose Aergia, a novel approach where slow clients (i) freeze the part of their model that is the most computationally intensive to train; (ii) train the unfrozen part of their model; and (iii) offload the training of the frozen part of their model to a faster client that trains it using its own dataset. The offloading decisions are orchestrated by the federator based on the training speed that clients report and on the similarities between their datasets, which are privately evaluated thanks to a trusted execution environment. We show through extensive experiments that Aergia maintains high accuracy and significantly reduces the training time under heterogeneous settings by up to 27% and 53% compared to FedAvg and TiFL, respectively.",
            "TLDR": "Aergia is proposed, a novel approach where slow clients freeze the part of their model that is the most computationally intensive to train; train the unfrozen part of the model; and offload the training of the frozen part oftheir model to a faster client that trains it using its own dataset."

            "Abstract": "Confidential computing services enable users to run their workloads in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) leveraging secure hardware like Intel SGX, and verify them by performing remote attestation. This process offers necessary proof for the integrity of users' software and the authenticity of the hardware, signed by a hardware-specific attestation key. Recent side-channel attacks have successfully retrieved such keys, enabling attackers to forge the attestation data and thereby undermining users' trust in their TEE. If the attestation proof is bound to a second hardware root of trust impervious to side-channel attacks, then the remote attestation process can maintain its security guarantees. In this paper, we introduce MATEE, a novel remote attestation mechanism for TEEs that creates a second chain of trust to a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), adding diverse redundancy into the existing attestation process. Targeting SGX enclaves for our prototype, as the most prominent TEE implementation to date, we describe how MATEE satisfies the necessary security requirements as well as present several scenarios that demonstrate its applicability and its benefits to the confidential computing landscape.",
            "TLDR": "MATEE is introduced, a novel remote attestation mechanism for TEEs that creates a second chain of trust to a Trusted Platform Module (TPM), adding diverse redundancy into the existing attestation process."

            "Abstract": "Machine Learning (ML) has emerged as a core technology to provide learning models to perform complex tasks. Boosted by Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS), the number of applications relying on ML capabilities is ever increasing. However, ML models are the source of different privacy violations through passive or active attacks from different entities. In this paper, we present MixNN a proxy-based privacy-preserving system for federated learning to protect the privacy of participants against a curious or malicious aggregation server trying to infer sensitive information (i.e., membership and attribute inferences). MixNN receives the model updates from participants and mixes layers between participants before sending the mixed updates to the aggregation server. This mixing strategy drastically reduces privacy leaks without any trade-off with utility. Indeed, mixing the updates of the model has no impact on the result of the aggregation of the updates computed by the server. We report on an extensive evaluation of MixNN using several datasets and neural networks architectures to quantify privacy leakage through membership and attribute inference attacks as well the robustness of the protection. We show that MixNN significantly limits both the membership and attribute inferences compared to a baseline using model compression and noisy gradient (well known to damage the utility) while keeping the same level of utility as classic federated learning.",

To craft a \"pure\" serverless solution, the common practice is to transfer intermediate data between serverless functions via serverless object storage (IBM COS; AWS S3). However, prior works have led to inconclusive results about the performance of object storage, since they have left large margin for optimization. To verify that object storage has been underrated, we design a novel shuffle manager for serverless data analytics termed Seer. Specifically, Seer dynamically chooses between two shuffle algorithms to maximize performance. The algorithm choice is based on some predictive models, and very importantly, without users having to specify intermediate data sizes at the time of the job submission. We integrate Seer with PyWren-IBM [31], a serverless analytics framework, and evaluate it against both serverful (e.g., Spark) and serverless systems (e.g., Google BigQuery). Our results certify that our new shuffle manager can deliver performance improvements over them.",

            "Abstract": "Low-power operating system runtimes used on IoT microcontrollers typically provide rudimentary APIs, basic connectivity and, sometimes, a (secure) firmware update mechanism. In contrast, on less constrained hardware, networked software has entered the age of serverless, microservices and agility. With a view to bridge this gap, in the paper we design Femto-Containers, a new middleware runtime which can be embedded on heterogeneous low-power IoT devices. Femto-Containers enable the secure deployment, execution and isolation of small virtual software functions on low-power IoT devices, over the network. We implement Femto-Containers, and provide integration in RIOT, a popular open source IoT operating system. We then evaluate the performance of our implementation, which was formally verified for fault-isolation, guaranteeing that RIOT is shielded from logic loaded and executed in a Femto-Container. Our experiments on various popular micro-controller architectures (Arm Cortex-M, ESP32 and RISC-V) show that Femto-Containers offer an attractive trade-off in terms of memory footprint overhead, energy consumption, and security.",
            "TLDR": "Femto-Containers is designed, implemented and provided in RIOT, a popular open source IoT operating system, to enable the secure deployment, execution and isolation of small virtual software functions on low-power IoT devices, over the network."

            "Abstract": "The number of fake news written by bots or malicious actors on social media is rising. One cause is the ability of users to post anything, at any place, at any time. This offers great flexibility, but it also poses the risk that users share misinformation. One type includes events that allegedly have occurred in a location, without the reporting user necessarily having been present. A user may add her location to posts to appear as an eyewitness and thus more trustworthy; however, basing that trust on commonly used and easily faked GPS locations is not reasonable. We present EventChain, which enriches social media posts with hard to fake trust scores based on the user's recent motion profile to give actual eyewitnesses more credibility. Users' motion profiles are integrity- and privacy-preservingly logged in a blockchain. Once the user posts an event, her locality is evaluated for a location rating. The location evaluation is secured by a trusted execution environment to ensure users' location data is private and under the users' control at all times. EventChain also enables interactive assessments of a post via nearby users, whose location is similarly evaluated. This way other eyewitnesses can credibly provide further information, thus leading to a consensus about the event's actual occurrences, increasing trust in social media posts, and limiting the spread of fake news.",
            "TLDR": "EventChain is presented, which enriches social media posts with hard to fake trust scores based on the user's recent motion profile to give actual eyewitnesses more credibility, increasing trust in social media Posts, and limiting the spread of fake news."

            "Abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning paradigm that enables a cluster of decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train a shared machine learning model without exposing users' raw data. However, the intensive model training computation is energy-demanding and poses severe challenges to end devices' battery life. In this paper, we present BoFL, a training pace controller deployed on the edge devices that actuates the hardware operational frequencies over multiple configurations to achieve energy-efficient federated learning. BoFL operates in an explore-then-exploit manner within limited rounds of FL tasks. BoFL explores the large hardware frequency space strategically with a tailor-designed Bayesian optimization algorithm. BoFL first finds a set of good operational configurations within few task training rounds, and then exploits these configurations in the remaining rounds to achieve minimized energy consumption for model training. Experiments on multiple real-world edge devices with different FL tasks suggest that BoFL can reduce energy consumption of model training by around 26%, and achieve near-optimal energy efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "Using a flash-based layer to serve the caching and buffering needs of multiple workloads has become a common practice. In such settings, resource demands will inevitably exceed available capacity sometimes. \"Fair\" resource allocation may offer a systematic way of partitioning resources across competing workloads during such periods of scarcity. Existing works only offer fair allocation strategies for a single resource (capacity or bandwidth) within a flash device in isolation. However, since there exist multiple critical resources that need to be partitioned within a flash device and they are correlated to each other, fair allocation of a single resource may result in a waste of other resource(s) or performance degradation of workload(s). To this end, we make a case for multi-resource fair allocation solutions for flash-based caches that consolidate multiple workloads. Furthermore, we argue that device lifetime, which depends on the behavior of running workloads, should also be considered as a first-class resource on par with capacity and bandwidth. Specifically, we build upon existing ideas related to dominant resource fairness (DRF) to devise flash-specific multi-resource fair algorithms: (i) nDRF, that jointly allocates capacity and bandwidth taking their non-linear relationship into account; (ii) ℓDRF, that explicitly considers lifetime as well in its allocation; and (iii) several variants of these. Our experimental evaluation offers important findings: (i) both nDRF and ℓDRF result in superior performance fairness compared to the state-of-the-art techniques that partition capacity in isolation; (ii) ℓDRF additionally offers improved device \"wear\" behavior; and (iii) our algorithms combined with reasonable demand prediction work very well in online settings with workload dynamism and uncertainty.",

            "Abstract": "Raw flash file systems are essential in today's cost-sensitive embedded systems and legacy embedded devices. The performance of raw flash file systems is often limited by their inefficient garbage collection (GC) due to the tight capacity of the onboard flash memory and CPU computing power. However, in real-world scenarios, we observed that the GC overhead can account for more than 85% of the total I/O time, which not only degrades the performance of the file system but also shortens the endurance of the flash chip. However, existing GC optimization used in high-end SSD or server-side file systems usually leads to high CPU and memory usage, which is not suitable for the embedded environment. In this paper, we propose LightGC, a low-complexity and high-efficiency GC scheme. We design an optimized clustering algorithm for page hotness measurement and a hot-delay GC victim selection strategy. LightGC can also be adapted to locality changes in workloads to maximize the effect of cold and heat separation. Our experimental results show that LightGC offers a relative improvement of up to 19% in GC efficiency, a 5%-15% reduction in write amplification, and a 10%-17% increase in flash memory endurance compared to other existing GC methods. In addition, driven by LightGC, we implement the UBIFS2 file system, an upgraded version of the UBIFS flash file system. We have done careful engineering design so that UBIFS2 and the original UBIFS are compatible with each other and users can switch between them freely.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes LightGC, a low-complexity and high-efficiency GC scheme that is based on an optimized clustering algorithm for page hotness measurement and a hot-delay GC victim selection strategy, and implements the UBIFS2 file system, an upgraded version of the U BIFS flash file system."

            "Abstract": "Autotuning DNN models prior to their deployment is an essential but time-consuming task. Using expensive (and power-hungry) GPU and TPU accelerators efficiently is also key. Since DNNs do not always use a GPU fully, spatial multiplexing of multiple models can provide just the right amount of GPU resources for each DNN. We find that a DNN model tuned with the maximum GPU resources has higher inference latency if less GPU resources are available at inference time. We present methods to tune a DNN model, so that we provide the right amount of accelerator resources during tuning. Thus, even when a wide range of GPU resources are available at inference time, the tuned model achieves low inference latency. Further, existing autotuning frameworks take a long time to tune a model due to inefficient utilization of the client and server-side CPU and GPU. Our system, Slice-Tune, improves several autotuning frameworks to efficiently use system resources by re-thinking the partitioning of tasks between the client and server (where models are profiled on the server GPU), in a Kubernetes environment. We increase parallelism during tuning by sharding the tuning model across multiple tuning application instances, providing concurrent tuning of different operators of a model. We also scale server instances to achieve better GPU multiplexing. Slice-Tune reduces DNN autotuning time in a single GPU and in GPU clusters. Slice-Tune decreases DNN autotuning time by up to 75%, and increase autotuning throughput by a factor of 5, across 3 different autotuning frameworks (TVM, Ansor, and Chameleon).",

            "Abstract": "The ability to scale out training workloads has been one of the key performance enablers of deep learning. The main scaling approach is data-parallel GPU-based training, which has been boosted by hardware and software support for highly efficient point-to-point communication, and in particular via hardware bandwidth over-provisioning. Overprovisioning comes at a cost: there is an order of magnitude price difference between \"cloud-grade\" servers with such support, relative to their popular \"consumer-grade\" counterparts, although single server-grade and consumer-grade GPUs can have similar computational envelopes. In this paper, we show that the costly hardware overprovisioning approach can be supplanted via algorithmic and system design, and propose a framework called CGX, which provides efficient software support for compressed communication in ML applications, for both multi-GPU single-node training, as well as larger-scale multi-node training. CGX is based on two technical advances: At the system level, it relies on a re-developed communication stack for ML frameworks, which provides flexible, highly-efficient support for compressed communication. At the application level, it provides seamless, parameter-free integration with popular frameworks, so that end-users do not have to modify training recipes, nor significant training code. This is complemented by a layer-wise adaptive compression technique which dynamically balances compression gains with accuracy preservation. CGX integrates with popular ML frameworks, providing up to 3X speedups for multi-GPU nodes based on commodity hardware, and order-of-magnitude improvements in the multi-node setting, with negligible impact on accuracy.",

            "Abstract": "Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) achieves great success in various domains. Communication in today's DRL algorithms takes non-negligible time compared to the computation. However, prior DRL frameworks usually focus on computation management while paying little attention to communication optimization, and fail to utilize the opportunity of the communication-computation overlap that hides the communication from the critical path of DRL algorithms. Consequently, communication can take more time than the computation in prior DRL frameworks. In this paper, we present XingTian, a novel DRL framework that co-designs the management of communication and computation in DRL algorithms. XingTian organizes the computation in DRL algorithms in a decentralized way and provides an asynchronous communication channel. XingTian makes the communication execute asynchronously and aggressively and takes advantage of the communication-computation overlapping opportunity from DRL algorithms. Experimental results show that XingTian improves data transmission efficiency and can transmit at least twice as much data per second as the state-of-the-art DRL framework RLLib. DRL algorithms based on XingTian achieve up to 70.71% more throughput than RLLib-based ones with better or similar convergent performance. XingTian maintains high communication efficiency under different scale deployments and the XingTian-based DRL algorithm achieves 91.12% higher throughput than the RLLib-based one when deployed in four machines. XingTian is open-sourced and publicly available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/xingtian.",
            "TLDR": "XingTian is a novel DRL framework that co-designs the management of communication and computation in DRL algorithms in a decentralized way and provides an asynchronous communication channel that maintains high communication efficiency under different scale deployments."

            "Abstract": "Light clients have been widely used in blockchain systems to support lightweight nodes by synchronizing and verifying block headers only. However, there are two major limitations with the current light client design. First, with the ever increasing blockchain size, the cost for light clients to process and store all the block headers would soon become prohibitively high. Second, only simple queries can be supported by light clients due to the limited functionality of block headers. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose DCert, a novel decentralized certification framework, to enable superlight clients with constant storage and state validation costs. The main idea is to leverage a trusted enclave (e.g., Intel SGX) to recursively certify the entire history of the blockchain. With DCert, the blockchain integrity can be easily validated by superlight clients with a secure certificate. Furthermore, to support rich verifiable queries on light clients, DCert can be extended to certify authenticated indexes for different types of queries on an as-needed basis. While DCert is compatible with existing blockchain systems, its security is guaranteed by the trusted enclave. Our benchmark-based empirical study shows that DCert incurs a small certification overhead, yet it is capable of supporting efficient verifiable queries with a constant storage size of 2.97 KB and a constant bootstrapping time of 0.14 ms.",

            "Abstract": "Mission-critical, real-time, continuous stream processing applications that interact with the real world have stringent latency requirements. For example, e-commerce websites like Amazon improve their marketing strategy by performing real-time advertising based on customers' behavior, and latency long tail can cause significant revenue loss. Recent work [39] showed a positive correlation between latency long tail and variance in the execution time of synchronous invocation chains (critical paths) in microservices benchmarks. This paper shows that asynchronous, very short but intense resource demands (called millibottlenecks) outside of critical paths can also cause significant latency long tail. Using a traffic analysis stream processing application benchmark, we evaluated the impact of asynchronous workload bursts generated by a multi-layer data structure called LSM-tree (log-structured merge-tree) for continuous checkpointing. Outside of the critical path, LSM-tree relies on maintenance operations (e.g., flushing/compaction during a checkpoint) to reorganize LSM-tree in memory and on disk to keep data access latency short. Although asynchronous, such recurrent maintenance operations can cause frequent millibottlenecks, particularly when they overlap, a problem we call ShadowSync. For scheduling and statistical reasons, significant latency long tail can arise from ShadowSync caused by asynchronous recurrent operations. Our experimental results show that with typical settings of benchmark components such as RocksDB, ShadowSync can prolong request message latency by up to 2 seconds. We show effective mitigation methods can alleviate both scheduled and statistical ShadowSync reducing the latency long tail to less than 20% of the original at the 99.9th percentile.",
            "TLDR": "This paper evaluates the impact of asynchronous workload bursts generated by a multi-layer data structure called LSM-tree (log-structured merge-tree) for continuous checkpointing and shows that asynchronous, very short but intense resource demands outside of critical paths can also cause significant latency long tail."

            "Abstract": "Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) are popular for optimistic replication and ensuring strong eventual consistency (SEC) in distributed systems. However, reversibility is an underdeveloped functionality for CRDTs, despite its usefulness in system restoration from an erroneous state or undoing unwanted operations. In this paper, we define the concept and design of reversible CRDTs (rCRDTs). Reverse operations compensate for the effect of reversed updates, and they extend existing CRDT interfaces. Three abstractions for reversibility are proposed: reversing a single update, multiple causally related updates, and multiple logically related updates that capture the user intention behind the updates. Moreover, a replicated and distributed key-value store, rKVCRDT, is implemented as a proof of concept that integrates the support of reversible CRDTs. The rCRDTs' evaluation show that although adding reversibility affects the system's performance, the end result depends on multiple factors and varies based on the underlying CRDTs. System designers must consider the trade-off between the benefit of reversibility and the performance impact.",
            "TLDR": "The concept and design of reversible CRDTs are defined and three abstractions for reversibility are proposed: reversing a single update, multiple causally related updates, and multiple logically related updates that capture the user intention behind the updates."

            "Abstract": "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify correlations between the genetic variants and an observable characteristic such as a disease. Previous works presented privacy-preserving distributed algorithms for a federation of genome data holders that spans multiple institutional and legislative domains to securely compute GWAS results. However, these algorithms have limited applicability, since they still require a centralized instance to operate on the data and decide whether GWAS results can be safely disclosed, which violates privacy regulations, such as GDPR. In this work, we introduce GenDPR, a distributed middleware that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to securely determine a subset of the potential GWAS statistics that can be safely released. GenDPR achieves the same accuracy as centralized solutions, but requires transferring significantly less data because TEEs only exchange intermediary results but no genomes. Additionally, GenDPR can be configured to tolerate all-but-one honest-but-curious federation members colluding with the aim to expose genomes of correct members.",
            "TLDR": "GenDPR is introduced, a distributed middleware that leverages Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to securely determine a subset of the potential GWAS statistics that can be safely released and achieves the same accuracy as centralized solutions, but requires transferring significantly less data."

            "Abstract": "With the proliferation of high bandwidth cameras and AR/VR devices, and their increasing use in situation awareness applications, edge computing is gaining prominence to meet the throughput requirements of such applications. This work focuses on camera applications that perform real-time Machine Learning inferences on camera frames. We find that Machine Learning based camera applications suffer from hardware resource fragmentation due to models under-utilizing or over-utilizing the accelerator. Meanwhile, it is challenging to support fine-grained resource sharing for accelerators such as TPUs because they can only process requests sequentially in a run to completion fashion. We present MicroEdge, a multi-tenant low-cost edge cluster for camera processing applications running at the edge. MicroEdge provides multi-tenancy support for Coral TPUs by extending K3s, an edge-specific distribution of Kubernetes. Through an admission control algorithm, it allows for fractional assignment of TPU resources commensurate with the application pipeline requirements to ensure that the TPUs are fully utilized. Using real-time camera processing applications and a real-world trace, we show that MicroEdge can support up to 2.8x camera streams for a given hardware configuration compared to vanilla K3s, while maintaining scalability and performance requirements.",
            "TLDR": "MicroEdge provides multi-tenancy support for Coral TPUs by extending K3s, an edge-specific distribution of Kubernetes, which allows for fractional assignment of TPU resources commensurate with the application pipeline requirements to ensure that the T PUs are fully utilized."

            "Abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) opens new perspectives for training machine learning models while keeping personal data on the users premises. Specifically, in FL, models are trained on the users' devices and only model updates (i.e., gradients) are sent to a central server for aggregation purposes. However, the long list of inference attacks that leak private data from gradients, published in the recent years, have emphasized the need of devising effective protection mechanisms to incentivize the adoption of FL at scale. While there exist solutions to mitigate these attacks on the server side, little has been done to protect users from attacks performed on the client side. In this context, the use of Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) on the client side are among the most proposing solutions. However, existing frameworks (e.g., DarkneTZ) require statically putting a large portion of the machine learning model into the TEE to effectively protect against complex attacks or a combination of attacks. We present GradSec, a solution that allows protecting in a TEE only sensitive layers of a machine learning model, either statically or dynamically, hence reducing both the Trusted Computing Base (TCB) size and the overall training time by up to 30% and 56%, respectively compared to state-of-the-art competitors.",

            "Abstract": "Modern Byzantine Fault-Tolerant State Machine Replication (BFT-SMR) solutions focus on reducing communication complexity, improving throughput, or lowering latency. This work explores the energy efficiency of BFT-SMR protocols. First, we propose a novel SMR protocol that optimizes for the steady state, i.e., when the leader is correct. This is done by reducing the number of required signatures per consensus unit and the communication complexity by order of the number of nodes n compared to the state-of-the-art BFT-SMR solutions. Concretely, we employ the idea that a quorum (collection) of signatures on a proposed value is avoidable during the failure-free runs. Second, we model and analyze the energy efficiency of protocols and argue why the steady-state needs to be optimized. Third, we present an application in the cyber-physical system (CPS) setting, where we consider a partially connected system by optionally leveraging wireless multicasts among neighbors. We analytically determine the parameter ranges for when our proposed protocol offers better energy efficiency than communicating with a baseline protocol utilizing an external trusted node. We present a hypergraph-based network model and generalize previous fault tolerance results to the model. Finally, we demonstrate our approach's practicality by analyzing our protocol's energy efficiency through experiments on a CPS test bed. In particular, we observe as high as 64% energy savings when compared to the state-of-the-art SMR solution for n = 10 settings using BLE.",

            "Abstract": "The reliability of virtualization infrastructures in the face of availability issues is a long-standing problem. Current fault tolerance approaches such as live VM replication are effective at addressing external, accidental issues (e.g. hardware failures, power cuts, environmental disasters); however, against an active attacker exploiting zero-day denial-of-service (DoS) vulnerabilities in the hypervisor itself, these approaches do not address the root cause of said vulnerabilities, and therefore cannot protect against these issues. This is made more relevant by the prevalence of DoS vulnerabilities among many widely used hypervisors. We introduce heterogeneous replication, a new solution that enhances live VM replication so that VMs can be replicated across different hypervisors. We show that heterogeneous replication not only mitigates accidental failures from the external operational environment, but also mitigates DoS attacks arising from hypervisor vulnerabilities. We further show that heterogeneous replication can be used to increase the security of virtualized infrastructures without sacrificing availability. We build HERE, our implementation of the heterogeneous replication concept for replicating a protected VM across hypervisor boundaries. We describe the implementation of HERE, including details on the necessary VM state replications, as well as a dynamic checkpoint interval adjustment scheme that maximizes VM protection based on load levels. We evaluate HERE using various benchmarks to show that HERE meets the goal of protecting VMs from availability issues while adapting to the VM's computing load.",

            "Abstract": "Many data analytic systems have adopted a newly emerging compute resource, serverless (SL), to handle data analytics queries in a timely and cost-efficient manner, i.e., serverless data analytics. While these systems can start processing queries quickly thanks to the agility and scalability of SL, they may encounter performance-and cost-bottlenecks based on workloads due to SL's worse performance and more expensive cost than traditional compute resources, e.g., virtual machine (VM). In this paper, we introduce Smartpick, a SL-enabled scalable data analytics system that exploits SL and VM together to realize composite benefits, i.e., agility from SL and better performance with reduced cost from VM. Smartpick uses a machine learning prediction scheme, decision-tree based Random Forest with Bayesian Optimizer, to determine SL and VM configurations, i.e., how many SL and VM instances for queries, that meet cost-performance goals. Smartpick offers a knob for applications to allow them to explore a richer cost-performance tradeoff space opened by exploiting SL and VM together. To maximize the benefits of SL, Smartpick supports a simple but strong mechanism, called relay-instances. Smartpick also supports event-driven prediction model retraining to deal with workload dynamics. A Smartpick prototype was implemented on Spark and deployed on live testbeds, Amazon AWS and Google Cloud Platform. Evaluation results indicate 97.05% and 83.49% prediction accuracies respectively with up to 50% cost reduction as opposed to the baselines. The results also confirm that Smartpick allows data analytics applications to navigate the richer cost-performance tradeoff space efficiently and to handle workload dynamics effectively and automatically.",
            "TLDR": "Smartpick is introduced, a SL-enabled scalable data analytics system that exploits SL and VM together to realize composite benefits, i.e., agility from SL and better performance with reduced cost from VM."

            "Abstract": "Fast response time for modern web services that include numerous distributed and lightweight microservices becomes increasingly important due to its business impact. While hardware-only resource scaling approaches (e.g., FIRM [47] and PARSLO [40]) have been proposed to mitigate response time fluctuations on critical microservices, the re-adaptation of soft resources (e.g., threads or connections) that control the concurrency of hardware resource usage has been largely ignored. This paper shows that the soft resource adaptation of critical microservices has a significant impact on system scalability because either under- or over-allocation of soft resources can lead to inefficient usage of underlying hardware resources. We present Sora, an intelligent, fast soft resource adaptation management framework for quickly identifying and adjusting the optimal concurrency level of critical microservices to mitigate service-level objective (SLO) violations. Sora leverages online fine-grained system metrics and the propagated deadline along the critical path of request execution to quickly and accurately provide optimal concurrency setting for critical microservices. Based on six real-world bursty workload traces and two representative microservices benchmarks (Sock Shop and Social Network), our experimental results show that Sora can effectively mitigate large response time fluctuations and reduce the 99th percentile latency by up to 2.5× compared to the hardware-only scaling strategy FIRM [47] and 1.5× to the state-of-the-art concurrency-aware system scaling strategy ConScale.",
            "TLDR": "Sora is presented, an intelligent, fast soft resource adaptation management framework for quickly identifying and adjusting the optimal concurrency level of critical microservices to mitigate service-level objective (SLO) violations and can effectively mitigate large response time fluctuations."

            "Abstract": "Edge cloud computing is a promising programming and deployment paradigm to empower delay-sensitive applications. By executing close to the network edge, distributed applications can have quicker reactions to event occurrence and consequently prompter dynamic adaptations. In addition, recent improvements in connectivity support allow developers to benefit from heterogeneous and alternative communication technologies (e.g., RDMA, DPDK, XDP, etc.) to meet the requirements of network-intensive edge applications. However, exploiting these technologies makes applications statically tailored to a specific network interface; this significantly limits the potential of edge cloud computing, where application components should be able to migrate seamlessly at runtime. INSANE aims at solving that issue by exposing a technology-agnostic middleware API that lets developers simply specify their QoS communication requirements; the dynamic selection of the most appropriate technology on the currently hosting edge node is delegated to INSANE. The paper also presents how it is possible to develop two different INSANE-based applications (a decentralized messaging system and an image streaming framework) with a few lines of code. Finally, an extensive performance evaluation shows that our middleware adds very limited ns-scale overhead to the raw acceleration technologies.",

            "Abstract": "The emergence of numerous blockchain solutions, offering innovative approaches to optimise performance, scalability, privacy, and governance, complicates performance analysis. Reasons for the difficulty of benchmarking blockchains include, for example, the high number of system parameters to configure and the effort to deploy a blockchain network. In addition, performance data, which mostly comes from system vendors, is often opaque. We provide a reproducible evaluation of the performance of seven permissioned blockchain systems across different parameter settings. We employ an end-to-end approach, where the clients sending the transactions are fully involved in the data collection approach. Our results underscore the unique characteristics and limitations of the systems we examined. Due to the insights given, our work forms the basis for continued research to optimise the performance of blockchain systems.",
            "TLDR": "This work provides a reproducible evaluation of the performance of seven permissioned blockchain systems across different parameter settings using an end-to-end approach, where the clients sending the transactions are fully involved in the data collection approach."

            "Abstract": "For trusted execution environments (TEEs), remote attestation permits establishing trust in software executed on a remote host. It requires that the measurement of a remote TEE is both complete and fresh: We need to measure all aspects that might determine the behavior of an application, and this measurement has to be reasonably fresh. Performing measurements only at the start of a TEE simplifies the attestation but enables \"reuse\" attacks of enclaves. We demonstrate how to perform such reuse attacks for different TEE frameworks. We also show how to address this issue by enforcing freshness -- through the concept of a singleton enclave -- and completeness of the measurements. Completeness of measurements is not trivial since the secrets provisioned to an enclave and the content of the filesystem can both affect the behavior of the software, i.e., can be used to mount reuse attacks. We present mechanisms to include measurements of these two components in the remote attestation. Our evaluation based on real-world applications shows that our approach incurs only negligible overhead ranging from 1.03% to 13.2%.",

            "Abstract": "Manipulation of user transactions by miners in permissionless blockchain systems is a growing concern. This problem is a pervasive and systemic issue that incurs high costs for users of decentralised applications and is known as Miner Extractable Value (MEV). Furthermore, transaction manipulations create other issues such as congestion, higher fees, and system instability. Detecting transaction manipulations is difficult, even though it is known that they originate from the pre-consensus phase of transaction selection for building blocks, at the base layer of blockchain protocols. In this paper, we summarize known transaction manipulation attacks. We present LO, an accountable base layer protocol designed to detect and mitigate transaction manipulations. LO is built around the accurate detection of transaction manipulations and assignment of blame at the granularity of a single mining node. LO forces miners to log all the transactions they receive into a secure mempool data structure and to process them in a verifiable manner. Overall, LO quickly and efficiently detects censorship, injection or re-ordering attempts. Our performance evaluation shows that LO is also practical and only introduces a marginal performance overhead.",

            "Abstract": "Recent large-scale Byzantine-Fault-Tolerant (BFT) algorithms provide scalability at a low cost by exploiting a secure Random Peer Sampling (RPS) service: a service that provides a stream of random network nodes where no attacking entity can become over-represented. Unfortunately, producing good peer samples untainted by Byzantine behavior in a large-scale network is particularly difficult, with existing solutions unable to withstand aggressive attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel RPS algorithm, BASALT, that implements what we have termed a stubborn chaotic search over node IDs to counter attackers' attempts at becoming over-represented. Our evaluation based on a theoretical analysis, Monte Carlo simulations, and experiments on a live cryptocurrency network shows that BASALT delivers close-to-optimal protection against malicious behaviors and outperforms state-of-the-art solutions by a wide margin.",

            "Abstract": "Atomic multicast is a communication abstraction that allows for messages to be addressed to and reliably delivered by multiple process groups, while ensuring a partial order on delivered messages. Strong ordering guarantees can greatly simplify the design and implementation of distributed applications. One critical property for the performance and scalability of an atomic multicast protocol is that of genuineness: a protocol is said to be genuine if only the sender and destinations of a message are involved in ordering the message. This paper presents PrimCast, the first genuine atomic multicast protocol able to deliver messages at every destination in three communication steps. PrimCast uses a primary-based consensus protocol for deciding on message timestamps at each group. Differently from previous work, it does not rely on consensus for advancing and maintaining logical clocks. PrimCast introduces a novel approach, relying on simple quorum intersection, to decide when a multicast message can be delivered. We also show how loosely synchronized clocks can be used to reduce the convoy effect that delays messages under high system load. We present the complete algorithm for PrimCast and evaluate its performance under various scenarios. Our results show that PrimCast achieves lower latency than state-of-the-art approaches while providing higher or comparable throughput.",

            "Abstract": "Existing permissioned blockchains often rely on coordination-based consensus protocols to ensure the safe execution of applications in a Byzantine environment. Furthermore, the protocols serialize the transactions by ordering them in a global order. The serializ-ability preserves the correctness of the application's state stored on the blockchain. However, coordination-based protocols limit the throughput and scalability and induce high latency. In contrast, application-level correctness requirements exist that are not dependent on the order of transactions, known as invariant-confluence (I-confluence). The I-confluent applications can execute transactions in a coordination-free manner, benefiting from the improved scalability compared to the coordination-based approaches. The safety and liveness of I-confluent applications are studied in non-Byzantine environments, but the correct execution of such applications remains a challenge in Byzantine coordination-free environments. We introduce OrderlessChain, a novel permissioned blockchain based on a novel BFT coordination-free protocol for the safe and live execution of I-confluent applications in a Byzantine environment. We implemented a prototype of our system, and our evaluation results show that our coordination-free approach performs significantly better than coordination-based blockchains.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed machine learning (DML) environments are widely used in many application domains to build decision-making systems. However, the complexity of these environments is overwhelming for novice users. On the one hand, data scientists are more familiar with hyper-parameter tuning and typically lack an understanding of the trade-offs and challenges of parameterizing DML platforms to achieve good performance. On the other hand, system administrators focus on tuning distributed platforms, unaware of the possible implications of the platform on the quality of the learning models. To shed light on such parameter configuration interplay, we run multiple DML workloads on the widely used Apache Spark distributed platform, leveraging 13 popular learning methods and 6 real-world datasets on two distinct clusters. We collect and perform an in-depth analysis of workload execution traces to compare the efficiency of different configuration strategies. We consider tuning only hyper-parameters, tuning only platform parameters, and jointly tuning both hyper-parameters and platform parameters. We publicly release our collected traces and derive key takeaways on DML workloads. Counter-intuitively, platform parameters have a higher impact on the model quality than hyper-parameters. More generally, we show that multi-level parameter configuration can provide better results in terms of model quality and execution time while also optimizing resource costs.",

            "Abstract": "The growing popularity of the data stream abstraction entails new challenging requirements when it comes to data ingestion and storage. Many organizations expect to retain data streams for extended periods of time and to store such stream data in a cost-effective manner. It is also crucial to reconcile apparently opposite properties, like data durability and consistency, along with high performance. Furthermore, data streams should not only deal with a high degree of parallelism, but also adapt to fluctuating workloads with little or no admin intervention. To our knowledge, no storage system for data streams fully copes with all these requirements. In this paper, we present Pravega: a distributed, tiered storage system for data streams. Pravega streams are unbounded by design and cost-effective, as the system automatically moves data to a long-term storage tier (e.g., S3, NFS) and transparently manages it for the user. Pravega guarantees no duplicate or missing events, as well as per routing-key event ordering, while providing high performance streaming IO and historical reads. As a unique feature, Pravega streams are elastic: they can automatically change their degree of parallelism based on the ingestion workload. We compared the performance of Pravega with Apache Kafka and Apache Pulsar on AWS. Our results certify that Pravega can deliver performance improvements over them in many scenarios.",
            "TLDR": "This paper presents Pravega: a distributed, tiered storage system for data streams, which is unbounded by design and cost-effective, as the system automatically moves data to a long-term storage tier and transparently manages it for the user."

            "Abstract": "Asynchronous Byzantine Fault-Tolerant (BFT) consensus protocols maintain strong consistency across nodes (i.e., ensure safety) and terminate probabilistically (i.e., ensure liveness) despite unbounded network delay. In contrast to protocols under partial synchrony, asynchronous counterparts pay no extra timing assumptions for electing a special role, and thus is more robust to network issues. To formally study this feature, we propose a new classification method for consensus and accordingly categorize relevant work: timing-balanced protocols are those that do not introduce strictly stronger timing-related assumptions for liveness, compared to ones required by safety. We further propose ThemiX, a novel timing-balanced protocol under the hybrid model: either there is no corrupt node, or the number of correct and online nodes constitute a majority. ThemiX tolerates f Byzantine faults with a total of n = 2f + 1 nodes, achieving optimal resilience. If every node is honest or benign, ThemiX is an asynchronous protocol. Otherwise, ThemiX relies on timing assumptions for ensuring safety and probabilistic termination. No leader or any special role is elected. To boost performance, we further integrate two practical mechanisms that respectively allow ThemiX to proceed at the pace of actual network speed and bypass the expensive coin-tossing phase (i.e., randomization). Large-scale experiments on Amazon EC2 platform show that ThemiX achieves up to 86% reduction in latency compared to the consensus component of HoneyBadgerBFT and provides sustainable performance under simulated network faults.",

            "Abstract": "With the slowing of Moore's law and decline of Dennard scaling, computing systems increasingly rely on specialized hardware accelerators in addition to general-purpose compute units. Increased hardware heterogeneity necessitates disaggregating applications into workflows of fine-grained tasks that run on a diverse set of CPUs and accelerators. Current accelerator delivery models cannot support such applications efficiently, as (1) the overhead of managing accelerators erases performance benefits for fine-grained tasks; (2) exclusive accelerator use per task leads to underutilization; and (3) specialization increases complexity for developers. We propose adopting concepts from Function-as-a-Service (FaaS), which has solved these challenges for general-purpose CPUs in cloud computing. Kernel-as-a-Service (KaaS) is a novel serverless programming model for generic compute accelerators that aids heterogeneous workflows by combining the ease-of-use of higher-level abstractions with the performance of low-level hand-tuned code. We evaluate KaaS with a focus on the breadth of the idea and its generality to diverse architectures rather than on an in-depth implementation for a single accelerator. Using proof-of-concept prototypes, we show that this programming model provides performance, performance efficiency, and ease-of-use benefits across a diverse range of compute accelerators. Despite increased levels of abstraction, when compared to a naive accelerator implementation, KaaS reduces completion times for fine-grained tasks by up to 96.0% (GPU), 68.4% (FPGA), 98.6% (TPU), and 34.9% (QPU) in our experiments.",
            "TLDR": "KaaS is a novel serverless programming model for generic compute accelerators that aids heterogeneous workflows by combining the ease-of-use of higher-level abstractions with the performance of low-level hand-tuned code and is evaluated with a focus on the breadth of the idea and its generality to diverse architectures."

            "Abstract": "Trusted execution environments like Intel SGX provide enclaves, which offer strong security guarantees for applications. Running entire applications inside enclaves is possible, but this approach leads to a large trusted computing base (TCB). As such, various tools have been developed to partition programs written in languages such as C or Java into trusted and untrusted parts, which are run in and out of enclaves respectively. However, those tools depend on language-specific taint-analysis and partitioning techniques. They cannot be reused for other languages and there is thus a need for tools that transcend this language barrier. We address this challenge by proposing a multi-language technique to specify sensitive code or data, as well as a multi-language tool to analyse and partition the resulting programs for trusted execution environments like Intel SGX. We leverage GraalVM's Truffle framework, which provides a language-agnostic abstract syntax tree (AST) representation for programs, to provide special AST nodes called secure nodes that encapsulate sensitive program information. Secure nodes can easily be embedded into the ASTs of a wide range of languages via Truffle's polyglot API. Our technique includes a multi-language dynamic taint tracking tool to analyse and partition applications based on our generic secure nodes. Our extensive evaluation with micro- and macro-benchmarks shows that we can use our technique for two languages (Javascript and Python), and that partitioned programs can obtain up to 14.5% performance improvement as compared to unpartitioned versions.",

            "Abstract": "Datacenters rapidly evolve by adopting new features such as new hardware deployment and software patches. Adopting a new feature requires an accurate evaluation of its impact to minimize the risk to the multi-million dollar computing infrastructure. However, a comprehensive performance analysis of a datacenter is extremely challenging due to its cost and multitenancy. Evaluating the performance in a live datacenter is accurate but prohibitive to prevent any damage to production services. Using conventional load-testing benchmarks on small-scale testbeds is imprecise as they do not consider the effect of other co-located jobs. In this paper, we propose FLARE, a fast, lightweight, and accurate performance evaluation method using representative datacenter behaviors. The key idea is to extract a small set of representative job colocation scenarios from all possible job colocations in a target datacenter. FLARE systematically characterizes and groups job colocations according to performance and resource metrics, providing high-level insights into the datacenter's behaviors. Then, it reconstructs the colocations on a testbed and allows accurate feature evaluation with load-testing benchmarks. We evaluate FLARE using an in-house datacenter and three features: cache sizing, DVFS, and SMT configurations. FLARE accurately estimates the impact of features with less than 1% errors by incurring 50× and 10× lower evaluation costs compared to full datacenter and sampling-based evaluation, respectively.",

            "Abstract": "Publish-subscribe messaging is a popular communication paradigm in the (Industrial) Internet of Things, and the Data Distribution Service (DDS) is a well known standard for pub-sub communication middleware. Many vendor implementations of DDS exist, leaving users with the need to choose according to project and performance requirements. However, the wide range of parameters in DDS implementations not covered in the standard specification make this selection difficult and time-consuming. We present DDS-Perf, a novel and versatile cross-vendor benchmarking tool for performance analysis, and use it to provide data from studies on 4 popular DDS implementations (OpenDDS, RTI Connext, FastDDS and CycloneDDS) across a wide range of experimental setups. DDS-Perf allows us to provide a consistent methodology across all vendors, increasing fairness and comparability. Overall, we find that RTI Connext achieves the best all-round performance (exhibiting the best bandwidth and peak sample rate), while FastDDS (best end-to-end latency) and CycloneDDS also show promising results.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless data analytics generate a large amount of intermediate data during computation stages. However, serverless functions, which are short-lived and lack direct communication, face significant challenges in managing this data effectively. The traditional approach of using object storage to carry the data proves to be slow and costly, as it involves constant movement of data back and forth. Although specialized ephemeral storage solutions have been developed to address this issue, they fail to tackle the fundamental challenge of minimizing data movements. This work focuses on incorporating near-data computation into an ephemeral storage system to reduce the volume of transferred data in serverless analytics. We present Glider with the aim to enhance communication between serverless compute stages, allowing data to smoothly \"glide\" through the processing pipeline instead of bouncing between different services. Glider achieves this by leveraging stateful near-data execution of complex data-bound operations and an efficient I/O streaming interface. Under evaluation, it reduces data transfers by up to 99.7%, improves storage utilization by up to 99.8%, and enhances performance by up to 2.7×. In sum, Glider improves serverless data analytics by optimizing data movement, streamlining processing, and avoiding redundant transfers.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless computing is getting increasingly popular because of its fine-grained billing model and autoscaling features. To speed up the process of functions' sandbox creation, cloud providers typically utilize snapshot and restore-based mechanisms for pre-warmed snapshots. This effectively trades off the startup latency with the storage requirements and the overhead of creating/restoring these snapshots. Hence, there is a need to compress the snapshots by identifying identical data chunks across snapshots and then design methods to quickly deduplicate snapshots and retrieve them. We propose SnapStore -- a novel method of finding such duplicates. As opposed to conventional work that relies on better hashing methods, we use the natural structure of the program's memory map to reduce wasted work during deduplication. Furthermore, we sequentialize and minimize disk accesses as much as possible while retrieving a snapshot into a RAM-based cache. Both of these optimizations, yield a reasonably large speedup in the deduplication process as compared to the state-of-the-art (≈ 46% in the snapshot deduplication time and ≈ 82.6% in the retrieval time on HDDs). Upon integration with FaaSnap (a state-of-the-art serverless platform), SnapStore improves the end-to-end latency of serverless functions by 25.9% along with 2.4× storage space reduction over vanilla FaaSnap on HDDs. With SSDs, our deduplication time and retrieval time reduce by 36.2% and 75.8%, respectively, with almost no degradation in the end-to-end latency.",
            "TLDR": "SnapStore is proposed -- a novel method of finding duplicate data chunks across snapshots by using the natural structure of the program's memory map to reduce wasted work during deduplication and improves the end-to-end latency of serverless functions."

            "Abstract": "Software is becoming increasingly complex and feature-rich, yet only part of any given codebase is frequently used. Existing software customization and debloating approaches target static binaries, focusing on feature discovery, control-flow analysis, and binary rewriting. As a result, the customized program binary has a smaller attack surface as well as less available functionality. This means that once a software's use scenario changes, the customized binary may not be usable. This paper presents DynaCut, for dynamic software code customization. DynaCut can disable \"not being used\" code features during software runtime and re-enable them when required again. DynaCut works at the binary level; no source code is needed. To achieve its goal, DynaCut includes a dynamic process rewriting technique that seamlessly and transparently updates the image of a running process, with specific code features blocked or re-enabled. To help identify potentially unused code, DynaCut employs an execution trace-based differential analysis to pinpoint the code related to specific software features, which can be dynamically turned on/off based on user configuration. We also develop automatic methods to locate code that is only temporally used (e.g., initialization code), which can be dropped in a timely manner (e.g., after the initialization phase). We prototype DynaCut and evaluate it using 3 widely used server applications and the SPECint2017_speed benchmark suite. The result shows that, compared to existing static binary customization approaches, DynaCut removes an additional 10% of code on average and up to 56% of temporally executed code due to the dynamic code customization.",

            "Abstract": "Atomic multicast is a communication abstraction where messages are propagated to groups of processes with reliability and order guarantees. Atomic multicast is at the core of strongly consistent storage and transactional systems. This paper presents FlexCast, the first genuine overlay-based atomic multicast protocol. Genuineness captures the essence of atomic multicast in that only the sender of a message and the message's destinations coordinate to order the message, leading to efficient protocols. Overlay-based protocols restrict how process groups can communicate. Limiting communication leads to simpler protocols and reduces the amount of information each process must keep about the rest of the system. FlexCast implements genuine atomic multicast using a complete DAG overlay. We experimentally evaluate FlexCast in a geographically distributed environment using gTPC-C, a variation of the TPC-C benchmark that takes into account geographical distribution and locality. We show that, by exploiting genuineness and workload locality, FlexCast outperforms well-established atomic multicast protocols without the inherent communication overhead of state-of-the-art non-genuine multicast protocols.",
            "TLDR": "FlexCast is presented, the first genuine overlay-based atomic multicast protocol that outperforms well-established atomic multicasts protocols without the inherent communication overhead of state-of-the-art non-genuine multicast protocols."

            "Abstract": "This paper presents the design and implementation of FLIPS, a middleware system to manage data and participant heterogeneity in federated learning (FL) training workloads. In particular, we examine the benefits of label distribution clustering on participant selection in federated learning. FLIPS clusters parties involved in an FL training job based on the label distribution of their data apriori, and during FL training, ensures that each cluster is equitably represented in the participants selected. FLIPS can support the most common FL algorithms, including FedAvg, FedProx, FedDyn, FedOpt and FedYogi. To manage platform heterogeneity and dynamic resource availability, FLIPS incorporates a straggler management mechanism to handle changing capacities in distributed, smart community applications. Privacy of label distributions, clustering and participant selection is ensured through a trusted execution environment (TEE). Our comprehensive empirical evaluation compares FLIPS with random participant selection, as well as three other \"smart\" selection mechanisms -- Oort [51], TiFL [15] and gradient clustering [27] using four real-world datasets, two different non-IID distributions and three common FL algorithms (FedYogi, FedProx and FedAvg). We demonstrate that FLIPS significantly improves convergence, achieving higher accuracy by 17-20 percentage points with 20-60% lower communication costs, and these benefits endure in the presence of straggler participants.",
            "TLDR": "It is demonstrated that FLIPS significantly improves convergence, achieving higher accuracy by 17-20 percentage points with 20-60% lower communication costs, and these benefits endure in the presence of straggler participants."

            "Abstract": "Confidential computing alleviates the concerns of distrustful customers by removing the cloud provider from their trusted computing base and resolves their disincentive to migrate their workloads to the cloud. This is facilitated by new hardware extensions, like AMD's SEV Secure Nested Paging (SEV-SNP), which can run a whole virtual machine with confidentiality and integrity protection against a potentially malicious hypervisor owned by an untrusted cloud provider. However, the assurance of such protection to either the service providers deploying sensitive workloads or the end-users passing sensitive data to services requires sending proof to the interested parties. Service providers can retrieve such proof by performing remote attestation while end-users have typically no means to acquire this proof or validate its correctness and therefore have to rely on the trustworthiness of the service providers. In this paper, we present Revelio, an approach that features two main contributions: i) it allows confidential virtual machine (VM)-based workloads to be designed and deployed in a way that disallows any tampering even by the service providers and ii) it empowers users to easily validate their integrity. In particular, we focus on web-facing workloads, protect them leveraging SEV-SNP, and enable end-users to remotely attest them seamlessly each time a new web session is established. To highlight the benefits of Revelio, we discuss how a standalone stateful VM that hosts an open-source collaboration office suite can be secured and present a replicated protocol proxy that enables commodity users to securely access the Internet Computer, a decentralized blockchain infrastructure.",
