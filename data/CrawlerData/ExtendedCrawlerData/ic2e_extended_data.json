            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is increasingly being adopted in different scenarios, like social networking, business applications, scientific experiments, etc. Relying in virtualization technology, the construction of these computing environments targets improvements in the infrastructure, such as power-efficiency and fulfillment of users' SLA specifications. The methodology usually applied is packing all the virtual machines on the proper physical servers. However, failure occurrences in these networked computing systems can induce substantial negative impact on system performance, deviating the system from ours initial objectives. In this work, we propose adapted algorithms to dynamically map virtual machines to physical hosts, in order to improve cloud infrastructure power-efficiency, with low impact on users' required performance. Our decision making algorithms leverage proactive fault-tolerance techniques to deal with systems failures, allied with virtual machine technology to share nodes resources in an accurately and controlled manner. The results indicate that our algorithms perform better targeting power-efficiency and SLA fulfillment, in face of cloud infrastructure failures.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud offerings are increasingly serving workloads with a large variability in terms of compute, storage and networking resources. Computing requirements (all the way to High Performance Computing or HPC), criticality, communication intensity, memory requirements, and scale can vary widely. Virtual Machine (VM) placement and consolidation for effective utilization of a common pool of resources for efficient execution of such diverse class of applications in the cloud is challenging, resulting in higher cost and missed Service Level Agreements (SLAs). For HPC, current cloud providers either offer dedicated cloud with dedicated nodes, losing out on consolidation benefits of virtualization, or use HPC-agnostic cloud scheduling resulting in poor HPC performance. In this work, we address application-aware allocation of n VM instances (comprising a single job request) to physical hosts from a single pool. We design and implement an HPC-aware scheduler on top of Open Stack Compute (Nova) and also incorporate it in a simulator (Cloud Sim). Through various optimizations, specifically topology- and hardware-awareness, cross-VM interference accounting and application-aware consolidation, we demonstrate enhanced VM placements which achieve up to 45% improvement in HPC performance and/or 32% increase in job throughput while limiting the effect of jitter (or noise) to 8%.",

            "Abstract": "Service isolation, achieved by deploying components of multi-tier applications using separate virtual machines (VMs), is a common \"best\" practice. Various advantages cited include simpler deployment architectures, easier resource scalability for supporting dynamic application throughput requirements, and support for component-level fault tolerance. This paper presents results from an empirical study which investigates the performance implications of component placement for deployments of multi-tier applications to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) clouds. Relationships between performance and resource utilization (CPU, disk, network) are investigated to better understand the implications which result from how applications are deployed. All possible deployments for two variants of a multi-tier application were tested, one computationally bound by the model, the other bound by a geospatial database. The best performing deployments required as few as 2 VMs, half the number required for service isolation, demonstrating potential cost savings with service consolidation. Resource use (CPU time, disk I/O, and network I/O) varied based on component placement and VM memory allocation. Using separate VMs to host each application component resulted in performance overhead of ~1-2%. Relationships between resource utilization and performance were harnessed to build a multiple linear regression model to predict performance of component deployments. CPU time, disk sector reads, and disk sector writes are identified as the most powerful performance predictors for component deployments.",

            "Abstract": "The emergence of the cloud and advanced object-based storage services provides opportunities to support novel models for long term preservation of digital assets. Among the benefits of this approach is leveraging the cloud's inherent scalability and redundancy to dynamically adapt to evolving needs of digital preservation. PDS Cloud is an OAIS-based preservation-aware storage service employing multiple heterogeneous cloud providers. It materializes the logical concept of a preservation information-object into physical cloud storage objects. Preserved information can be interpreted by deploying virtual appliances in the compute cloud provisioned with cloud storage data objects together with their designated rendering software. PDS Cloud has a hierarchical data model supporting independent tenants whose assets are organized in multiple aggregations based on content and value. Continuous changes to data objects, life-cycle activities, virtual appliances and cloud providers are applied in a manner transparent to the client. PDS Cloud is being developed as an infrastructure component of the European Union ENSURE project, where it is used for preservation of medical and financial data.",

            "Abstract": "Increasingly more and more web applications are migrating to the cloud owing to higher scalability, low cost, and reduced time-to-market. For example, Amazon Web Services (AWS) hosts PBS, Reddit, Netflix, Zynga. Although the elasticity of cloud enables scaling, both up and down, a cluster in response to the incoming traffic, it makes performance modeling and analysis non-trivial. In the context of Java-based web applications, a key aspect is the performance of the garbage collector (GC). Existing tools for analyzing the performance of a GC are tailored for a single Java process, hence not suitable for use in the cloud. To this end, in this paper we present a tool called {\\bf Shrek} for analyzing GC performance in the cloud. {\\bf Shrek} facilitates analysis of GC logs of Java applications deployed across a cluster of hundreds of nodes in the cloud. Further, it supports analytics such as time series analysis of GC performance metrics to determine ``bad&quot, nodes and supports visualization of, for example, promotion rate from the young generation to the old generation. {\\bf Shrek} has already been used to diagnose performance problems for multiple applications at Netflix.",

            "Abstract": "In multi-tenant collaborative cloud systems, the choice of cloud providers is based on pre-negotiated terms and conditions to help meet Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and streamline resource provisioning. However, these collaborations are not self-adaptive to accommodate changes in tenancy requirements, quality of resources and provider capabilities as provider collaborations remain static over tenancy period. In our paper, we present an approach towards achieving self-adaptive cloud collaborations. Our model selects the best possible cloud collaborations from amongst multiple possible dependent cloud provider collaboration links. The formation of cloud provider collaborations is broadly based on cloud provider capabilities, tenancy requirements, cost modeling of each cloud provider andits functional ability at the Software as a Service (SaaS) layer. We present an algorithm to form dynamic cloud collaborations and thereby determine the most appropriate linkages within the providers. We also illustrate our approach throughout our paper with a realistic running example, and present detailed experimental evaluation via a proof-of-concept prototype implementation.",

            "Abstract": "Currently many training systems acquired, fielded and sustained by the U.S. Army are unable to seamlessly comply with a continuously evolving and often complex computational environment. The current state of such training systems must advance to a Training as a Service (TaaS) future state in order to adapt to a volatile defense budget, conform to policy updates, and enhance the training capabilities afforded to the War fighter. TaaS will transform current Army training applications into distributed web-based services, allowing them to be accessible across any location via thin client workstations and wireless mobile devices. The motivation behind this migration is coming from the Common Operating Environment (COE) Architecture Guidance published by the U.S. Army Chief Information Officer and the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Acquisition, Logistics, and Technology. In order to achieve the COE objectives, the Army recently launched a pilot study on the Common Training Instrumentation Architecture (CTIA). CTIA is the foundation architecture of the Army's Live Training Transformation (LT2) Product Line that provides software infrastructure and services to live training product applications. This paper describes the migration of CTIA to TaaS using a specific set of modern computing technologies that will enable rapid delivery of training capabilities across servers, mobile devices, and heterogeneous platforms. Specifically service-oriented architecture (SOA) and cloud computing are considered which can satisfy the requirements of the TaaS and COE, and meet user demands for an enhanced training experience. Furthermore, this paper discusses the approach taken to elicit the future needs of the Army's live training community, and how cloud computing and SOA are leveraged to meet required capabilities. Lastly, this paper discusses some unique considerations on SOA-related security issues.",
            "TLDR": "The migration of CTIA is described, using a specific set of modern computing technologies that will enable rapid delivery of training capabilities across servers, mobile devices, and heterogeneous platforms, which can satisfy the requirements of the TaaS and COE, and meet user demands for an enhanced training experience."

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is becoming more and more popular, but security concerns overshadow its technical and economic benefits. In particular, insider attacks and malicious insiders are considered as one of the major threats and risks in cloud computing. As physical boundaries disappear and a variety of parties are involved in cloud services, it is becoming harder to define a security perimeter that divides insiders from outsiders, therefore making security assessments by cloud customers more difficult. In this paper, we propose a model that combines a comprehensive system model of infrastructure clouds with a security model that captures security requirements of cloud customers as well as characteristics of attackers. This combination provides a powerful tool for systematically analyzing attacks in cloud environments, supporting cloud customers in their security assessment by providing a better understanding of existing attacks and threats. Furthermore, we use the model to construct \"what-if\" scenarios that could possible lead to new attacks and to raise concerns about unknown threats among cloud customers.",

            "Abstract": "A critical challenge in cloud computing is assuring confidentiality and integrity for the execution of arbitrary software in a consumer's virtual machine. The problem arises from having multiple virtual machines sharing hardware resources in the same physical host. A security critical resource is random access memory, which in the current version of the Xen hyper visor is vulnerable to attacks. Like previous work demonstrated, this vulnerability originates from Xen adopting avery permissive memory access model for its management virtual machine (Dom0). The model assumes it is safe to grant Dom0full access to the memory space allocated to consumer's virtual machines. In this paper, we first present a sophisticated attack which makes it possible to compromise security-sensitive information resident in the memory area of a particular process executing in a virtual machine. The attack demonstration consists in subverting the new inter-virtual machine communication mechanism, libvchan, which is under development for the Xen hyper visor. This attack allows us to propose and implement a proof of concept for a lightweight mandatory memory access control mechanism for Xen, which achieves a better overall memory access model forDom0. We then propose an architecture which takes advantage of our memory protection mechanism and previous work to achievedefense in depth in cloud computing.",

            "Abstract": "One of the major security threats that public cloud computing platforms face today is that the active cloud virtual machine instances are visible and accessible via the public internet, which allows hackers to carry out several types of attacks such as Denial of Service (DoS) and intrusion over along durations which increases the probabilities of successful penetration. Security logs of the failed attempts attest to the real threat and the intensity and duration of these. Most systems running on public cloud instances today are not security hardened to withstand such persistent and long attacks. It is not only dangerous but also disastrous for the enterprise that uses such instances to deliver cloud services, for the users that use such services, and for the cloud provider that provides the cloud infrastructure. Therefore, what is required is a network level access control solution that facilitates delivery of cloud services while protecting the network perimeter of the solution in a useable and dynamically customisable manner. In this paper, we have described such a network-based access control solution for public cloud services that we have designed and developed and is applicable to any of the various cloud platforms available today. We have deployed our solution as part of the \"Security-as-a-Service\" model on IBM Smart Cloud Enterprise (SCE), and has been used for commercial delivery of cloud services. These applications have led to not only high level of security with no security attacks via network exposure on the services, but also significant savings on the cost of maintaining the security of such instances and services. We have also studied the challenges that network address translators (NATs) pose for network-based access control on public cloud, and have developed solutions for such challenges.",

            "Abstract": "Today, most enterprises are embracing the cloud computing paradigm to provide reliable access to business data for mobile consumers. The Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is one platform that is fault tolerant and highly scalable within the cloud provisioning landscape. However, the Amazon S3 facility relies on the submission of multiple identification credentials from the data consumer for the purposes of authentication and authorization. This authentication process introduces high communication latency which makes it uninteresting for mobile consumption of enterprise data in a highly distributed environment. This paper presents a middleware-centric framework called MiLAMob that simplifies the authentication process in real time. The middleware employs the OAuth 2.0 technique (E.g. Facebook, Google+, and Personal Login) to identify the end-user and uses security tokens to handle the tedious authentication with Amazon S3 on behalf of the user/requester. The approach adopted by this paper proves that mobile consumers can efficiently access enterprise data hosted on Amazon S3 in a single request call with less processing effort. Also, the introduction of the middleware enforces additional data protection because the security credentials and the Amazon S3 abstractions are hidden from the mobile application domain and the end users.",

            "Abstract": "Understanding the resource utilization and server characteristics of large-scale systems is crucial if service providers are to optimize their operations whilst maintaining Quality of Service. For large-scale data enters, identifying the characteristics of resource demand and the current availability of such resources, allows system managers to design and deploy mechanisms to improve data enter utilization and meet Service Level Agreements with their customers, as well as facilitating business expansion. In this paper, we present a large-scale analysis of server resource utilization and a characterization of a production Cloud data enter using the most recent data enter trace logs made available by Google. We present their statistical properties, and a comprehensive coarse-grain analysis of the data, including submission rates, server classification, and server resource utilization. Additionally, we perform a fine-grained analysis to quantify the resource utilization of servers wasted due to the early termination of tasks. Our results show that data enter resource utilization remains relatively stable at between 40 - 60%, that the degree of correlation between server utilization and Cloud workload environment varies by server architecture, and that the amount of resource utilization wasted varies between 4.53 - 14.22% for different server architectures. This provides invaluable real-world empirical data for Cloud researchers in many subject areas.",

This paper investigates the idea of tolerating outages by inter-cloud replication, i.e., through service replication on multiple, fail-independent clouds. A challenge in realizing this idea is to minimize performance degradation that inevitably arises when replicas on multiple clouds have to be kept in a mutually consistent state over the Internet. It is addressed by developing a new order protocol that makes the most use of the high bandwidth communication within a cloud and uses the Internet communication to minimum necessary. The protocol also deals with cloud outages and widely differing rates with which service requests can arrive at replicas in different clouds. Experiments performed confirm that the protocol reduces the ordering latencies considerably and also improves throughput.",

For this to happen, parallel programming runtimes need to be designed for many-cores on chip as the target architecture. In this paper, we show that Map Reduce programming paradigm can be adapted to run on Intel's experimental single chip cloud computer (SCC) with 48-cores on chip. We demonstrate this using a Collaborative Filtering (CF) recommender system as an application. CF is widely used in e-commerce deployments to predict user's preference towards an unknown item from their past ratings. We address scalability with data partitioning, combining and sorting algorithms, maximize data locality to minimize communication cost within the SCC cores. We demonstrate ~2x speedup, ~94% lower power consumption for benchmark workloads as compared to a distributed cluster multi-processor nodes in use today.",

It includes a complex metadata extraction system capable of extracting elements, such as author name, title, citations and citation contexts that are crucial bibliometric data and for building a citation graph. The workload faced by the exractor is dynamic in nature and this variability makes CiteSeerx attractive for hosting in a cloud computing environment. Given its application binary dependencies and its reliance on a specialized infrastructure, the current extractor has several limitations. These limitations motivated the design and implementation of the metadata extraction system proposed in this study. A message oriented middleware architecture is used with a publish/subscribe pattern to build a scalable, flexible system that can be deployed across a range of cloud infrastructure. To demonstrate the broad applicability of the proposed system, we evaluate it in terms of its reference implementation across different scenarios of deployment and in regard to its scalability.",

However, little attention has been paid to how the legacy monolithic systems can be migrated to the cloud computing paradigm. The paper shares our experience and solutions on building a federated cloud infrastructure for E-learning services. The federated cloud system provides the ability to integrate, manage, and use third-party resources from multiple institutions and combines the resources into one infrastructure. We also provide experience and performance data from six month real trace of the system. While the discussion and experiments focus on cloud paradigm with education services, this research can serve as a reference design for other service providers who want to deploy services in the form of cloud computing.",

For these applications, end-to-end network bandwidth and latency matter greatly when cloud resources are used to augment the computational power and battery life of a mobile device. We first present quantitative evidence that this crucial design consideration to meet interactive performance criteria limits data center consolidation. We then describe an architectural solution that is a seamless extension of today's cloud computing infrastructure.",

            "Abstract": "As cloud computing clusters continue to grow, maintaining the health of these clusters becomes increasingly challenging. Recent work has studied how we can efficiently monitor the status of machines in these clusters and how we can detect problems or predict them before they occur, yet little work has focused on addressing the bottleneck between when these failures occur and when they are fixed: system administrators. As monitoring and failure detection systems mature, we are able to extract tremendous amounts of information about the status of the system in real time. However, this amount of data is difficult to understand for human beings, especially those inexperienced with the particular cluster. In this paper, we introduce a web-based visualization suite called Theius to allow system administrators to quickly understand the state of the cloud system as a whole. We outline the key features of this visualization tool, and show that it is more intuitive and easy to use than Ganglia, a state-of-the art visualization tool for clusters. Likewise, we demonstrate that our tool can scale, presenting a use case with our visualization showing a 5000 node cluster. Although our tool is implemented for Hadoop clusters, our contribution is general to any cloud computing system.",

            "Abstract": "SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) often uses multi-tenancy architecture (MTA) where tenant developers compose their applications online using the components stored in the SaaS database. Tenant applications need to be tested, and combinatorial testing can be used. While numerous combinatorial testing techniques are available, most of them produce static sequences of test configurations and their goal is often to provide sufficient coverage such as 2-way interaction coverage. But the goal of SaaS testing is to identify those compositions that are faulty for tenant applications. This paper proposes an adaptive test configuration generation algorithm AR (Adaptive Reasoning) that can rapidly identify those faulty combinations so that those faulty combinations cannot be selected by tenant developers for composition. The AR algorithm has been evaluated by both simulation and real experimentation using a MTA SaaS sample running on GAE (Google App Engine). Both the simulation and experiment showed show that the AR algorithm can identify those faulty combinations rapidly. Whenever a new component is submitted to the SaaS database, the AR algorithm can be applied so that any faulty interactions with new components can be identified to continue to support future tenant applications.",

Subsequently, these partitions depend on message exchange synchronization, which defines our choreography on the cloud. Moreover, we consider additional requirements related to data-dependencies and Quality of Service (QoS) disparities to optimize the execution of the outsourced process. Our approach is motivated by an insurance case study and implemented within an open source cloud platform.",

            "Abstract": "Compute clouds are pools of virtual machines that are shared in a multi-tenant environment by multiple users. The virtual machine images are stored in one or more repositories and are pre-configured with an operating system. Users of the compute cloud can upload their own images or install and configure additional software on top of existing basic virtual machines. Today, the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) counts more than 35,000 publicly available virtual machine images. We observe, however, that the meta-data that describes the virtual machine images is of poor quality and does not cover vital information such as operating system configurations or software package installations. The sprawl of poorly documented virtual machine images poses a hurdle to sharing and re-use among members of the compute cloud community. We present a method that allows collecting software-related meta-data in compute clouds through appliance introspection. Moreover, we show how applications in the domains of selection and configuration management benefit from rich meta-data and interact with the method. The method has been implemented as an automated tool, the crawler, that collects configuration data of virtual machine images in public compute clouds and evaluated our approach by crawling Amazon EC2.",

In the context of Web services and the de-facto workflow language BPEL, SOAP is used to encode the messages. When complex messages are exchanged between the processes, this can become costly and time consuming with respect to the overall execution time of a choreography. In this work, we suggest three different performance optimization techniques for workflow engines to reduce the number of message exchanges between the interacting processes and hence, to decrease the execution times and costs of the choreographies: intra-engine transport, service request caching, and inline execution. We describe how these techniques are implemented in a workflow engine. Performance measurements are carried out to determine the performance improvements that are achieved with each optimization technique. We further show that the optimizations also affect the energy consumption of the workflow engine.",

To address these challenges, we have developed a hybrid cloud architectural framework for controlling and managing network of integrated computing services in on- and off-premise cloud environments. We identify three types of integration patterns that are commonly observed and describe support in the hybrid cloud framework for such patterns. The framework allows creation, modification, and management of integrated hybrid cloud services. Using this framework, we describe how solutions can be designed for policy-based access to cloud services from on-premise environments and for policy-based secure access to on premise data from off-premise cloud based services. The framework offers capabilities for (i) on-demand capacity expansion or cloud-bursting, (ii) service composition and management across multiple cloud domains, (iii) unification and customization of service offerings from multiple cloud service providers, (iv) seamless integration of common workload management services such monitoring, metering, and security, and (v) unified governance of IT operation across the hybrid cloud. We then describe a realization of this architecture that has served as the basis of IBM's hybrid cloud solution offerings and describe how the hybrid cloud framework described here mitigates some of cloud adoption risks and lowers or eliminates the inhibitors.",

            "Abstract": "With the ever advancing technology of fast information processing, protecting data with only access control mechanisms is becoming increasingly difficult. If someone breaks into a database, the entire data will be compromised if it is in plaintext form. One quick remedy is to keep the data in encrypted form. However, encryption will make it difficult to do any operations on the data. This has prompted considerable research in the last decade and has led to various schemes of searchable encryption. It allows search over the encrypted data. There are various techniques which support different levels of querying, making it suitable for variety of applications. However, almost all of them are either symmetric-key or single-user schemes or require key sharing. Here, we are proposing a new scheme which will allow multiple users to encrypt, store and decrypt their own data, along with support for doing data searches over all the data by other users.",

            "Abstract": "Reducing the energy used in Cloud Computing is an important issue a sustainable society. There are many existing approaches for reducing energy use in data centers, but new approaches are needed in case of energy management of Cloud Computing. Cloud Computing involves decentralized data centers, so new flexible way for collecting energy consumption data becomes quite important. Many current approaches focus on reducing energy consumption by air handling equipment, however energy from IT resources also need to be optimized for a total energy management of Cloud Computing. For advanced energy management for Cloud Computing, we developed a Cloud energy management system with sensor management functions, with an optimized VM allocation tool to minimize energy consumption at multiple data centers.

The trend, causes, and impact of three types of incidents, namely, Outage, Vulnerability, and, failure during automatic updates (Auto Fail) were examined. Service availability was also analyzed based on the outage duration data. The analysis suggested that: (i) Outages and Vulnerabilities grow exponentially, while Auto Fail incidents show only a linear increase, (ii) Outages are caused by various sources of failures, Vulnerabilities primarily due to the lack of filtering inputs and most Auto Fail incidents are false positives, (iii) Many outages affected multiple, related services, some cascaded into additional ones during resolution, and the impact of some transcended organizational boundaries, and (iv) Availability of cloud services is less than 99%, and for free services such as Email it could be as low as 84%. The paper concludes with a summary of key observations and offers recommendations along three dimensions to avoid and alleviate the impact of cloud incidents.",

Configuration faults are harder to detect than on/off failures as it involves analysis of the parameters that constitute the configuration. While distributed systems become more complex and interconnected, the requirements on configuration fault localization have changed. In this paper we present a new, simple but effective approach to configuration fault localization, which utilizes the difference in configuration parameters of components that share a resource. We establish a Reference Configuration State (RCS) by determining a set of non-faulty probing components for each faulty component with respect to shared resources. Performing difference in configuration of reference state with that of the faulty components localizes faulty configuration parameter. Experiments through simulations demonstrate that our approach is effective in identifying configuration faults with reduced time and increased accuracy. Our algorithm gracefully handles the complexity of the problem as the system size grows.",

            "Abstract": "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) has emerged as a popular service model in the context of cloud computing. Examples of IaaS vendors include, but not limited to, Amazon's EC2, Rack space, GoGrid and the Google Compute Engine. Use of IaaS obviates the need for set up and maintenance of infrastructure and thereby boosts product development agility - a key in increasingly competitive landscape. However, the use of IaaS is much more expensive compared to use of an in-house data enter. This calls for development of techniques to minimize the cost overhead associated with the use of an IaaS without sacrificing its various benefits, e.g., elasticity of the cloud. In this paper we present novel techniques to optimize operational efficiency in the cloud. Specifically, we present three techniques targeted to different production scenarios. The techniques have been deployed in production and resulted in up to 50% reduction in operational costs for the target Netflix applications.",
            "TLDR": "Novel techniques to optimize operational efficiency in the cloud are presented and resulted in up to 50% reduction in operational costs for the target Netflix applications."

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is emerging as a paradigm for large-scale data-intensive applications. Cloud infrastructures allow users to remotely access to computing power and data over the Internet. Beside the huge economical impact, data centers consume enormous amount of electrical energy, contributing to high operational cost and carbon footprints to the environment. An advanced resource allocation model is therefore needed to not only reduce the energy consumption of data centers but also provide incentives to users to optimize their resource utilization and decrease the amount of energy consumed for executing their application. In particular, we present in this paper a novel resource allocation model using combinatorial auction mechanisms and taking into account the energy parameter. Based on this model, we propose three monotone and truthful algorithms used for winners determination and payments computation, namely exhaustive search algorithm (ESA), linear relaxation based randomized algorithm (LRRA) and green greedy algorithm (GGA). We perform numerical simulations to evaluate the performance of three proposed algorithms. Our numerical simulations show that the green greedy algorithm can significantly reduce the amount of consumed energy while generating higher revenue for cloud providers.",

As business processes and scientific jobs become more intricate, users may have unbalanced and evolving requirements that are associated to the specific underlying sub-job or service. In this paper, we investigate the problem of managing virtual resources for service workflows in a cloud environment and propose an agent-based framework that makes resource management decisions that are customized to optimize different levels of the application. To facilitate the management process, we introduce and evaluate an adaptive workflow configuration algorithm to assign virtual machines to services (composed within a workflow) while aggregating virtual machines on appropriately-resourced physical machines. We use simulations of real-world networked cluster traces to evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "The emergence of the cloud computing paradigm has greatly enabled innovative service models, such as Platform as a Service (PaaS), and distributed computing frameworks, such as Map Reduce. However, most existing cloud systems fail to distinguish users with different preferences, or jobs of different natures. Consequently, they are unable to provide service differentiation, leading to inefficient allocations of cloud resources. Moreover, contentions on the resources exacerbate this inefficiency, when prioritizing crucial jobs is necessary, but impossible. Motivated by this, we propose Abacus, a generic resource management framework addressing this problem. Abacus interacts with users through an auction mechanism, which allows users to specify their priorities using budgets, and job characteristics via utility functions. Based on this information, Abacus computes the optimal allocation and scheduling of resources. Meanwhile, the auction mechanism in Abacus possesses important properties including incentive compatibility (i.e., the users' best strategy is to simply bid their true budgets and job utilities) and monotonicity (i.e., users are motivated to increase their budgets in order to receive better services). In addition, when the user is unclear about her utility function, Abacus automatically learns this function based on statistics of her previous jobs. An extensive set of experiments, running on Hadoop, demonstrate the high performance and other desirable properties of Abacus.",

            "Abstract": "The growth in the adoption of cloud computing is driven by distinct and clear benefits for both cloud customers and cloud providers. However, the increase in the number of cloud providers as well as in the variety of offerings from each provider has made it harder for customers to choose. At the same time, the number of options to build a cloud infrastructure, from cloud management platforms to different interconnection and storage technologies, also poses a challenge for cloud providers. In this context, cloud experiments are as necessary as they are labor intensive. Cloud Bench [1] is an open-source framework that automates cloud-scale evaluation and benchmarking through the running of controlled experiments, where complex applications are automatically deployed. Experiments are described through experiment plans, containing directives with enough descriptive power to make the experiment descriptions brief while allowing for customizable multi-parameter variation. Experiments can be executed in multiple clouds using a single interface. Cloud Bench is capable of managing experiments spread across multiple regions and for long periods of time. The modular approach adopted allows it to be easily extended to accommodate new cloud infrastructure APIs and benchmark applications, directly by external users. A built-in data collection system collects, aggregates and stores metrics for cloud management activities (such as VM provisioning and VM image capture) and application runtime information. Experiments can be conducted in a highly controllable fashion, in order to assess the stability, scalability and reliability of multiple cloud configurations. We demonstrate Cloud Bench's main characteristics through the evaluation of an Open Stack installation, including experiments with approximately 1200 simultaneous VMs at an arrival rate of up to 400 VMs/hour.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud providers sell identically configured virtual machines (VMs) for the same price. Customers purchasing these VMs expect that they perform similarly and are allocated the same amount of virtual resources. In practice, however, the real performance of identically provisioned VMs depends on the underlying hardware, i.e., how the hardware is configured, and how much shared resources are consumed by co-located VMs. As workloads often have different resource requirements (e.g., CPU or disk I/O bound), a physical machine can be a better host to one VM than another, and swapping the locations of the two VMs can improve the performance (or any other metrics) of both VMs. However, cloud providers are unlikely to offer a VM swapping service since it is a tacit admission of providing different quality of services while charging the same rate. We propose, VBoom, a cloud provider-agnostic system in which VMs can dynamically relocate themselves (via location swapping) in a cloud environment if the new location better serves the needs of the VM. We discuss technical and business benefits and challenges in building such a system. When location matters, we believe that through VBoom, real estate of virtual machines can be established in a completely market-driven fashion.",

It provides a programming model in which processing logic may be implicitly distributed across a cluster of processing sites much like the Map Reduce framework but with augmented universality and extended expressiveness. As a result, the Katana framework consistently outperforms Map Reduce in our experiments on a 65 machines cluster with up to 144 GB of test data. In addition, the Katana framework functions on top of a structured P2P overlay, which is generally known to provide better scalability as compared to the master/worker architecture adopted by most Map Reduce implementations.",

Graph data analytics, however, poses several intrinsic challenges that are ill fitted to the popular Map Reduce programming model. This paper presents System G, a graph data management system that supports rich graph data, accepts online updates, complies with Hadoop, and runs efficiently by minimizing redundant data shuffling. These desirable capabilities are built on top of Apache HBase for scalability, updatability and compatibility. This paper introduces several exemplary target graph queries and global feature algorithms implemented using the newly available HBase Coprocessors. These graph algorithmic coprocessors execute on the server side directly on graph data stored locally and only communicates with remote servers for the dynamic algorithmic state, which is typically a small fraction of the raw data. Performance evaluation on real-world rich graph datasets demonstrated significant improvement over traditional Hadoop implementation, as prior works observed in their no-graph-shuffling solutions. Our work stands out at achieving the same or better performance without introducing incompatibility or scalability limitations.",

            "Abstract": "There is considerable interest in moving DBMS applications from inside enterprise data centers to the cloud, both to reduce cost and to increase flexibility and elasticity. Some of these applications are \"green field\" projects (i.e., new applications), others are existing legacy systems that must be migrated to the cloud. In another dimension, some are decision support applications while others are update-oriented. In this paper, we discuss the technical and political challenges that these various enterprise applications face when considering cloud deployment. In addition, a requirement for quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees will generate additional disruptive issues. In some circumstances, achieving good DBMS performance on current cloud architectures and future hardware technologies will be non-trivial. In summary, there is a difficult road ahead for enterprise database applications.",

At the core of this approach is a mechanism for selective real-time monitoring of guest file updates within VM instances. This mechanism is agentless, requiring no guest VM support. It has low virtual I/O overhead, low latency for emitting file updates, and a scalable design. Its central design principle is distributed streaming of file updates inferred from introspected disk sector writes. The mechanism, called DS-VMI, enables many system administration tasks that involve monitoring files to be performed outside VMs.",

            "Abstract": "The dynamic and elastic nature of cloud computing introduces new security challenges when it comes to maintaining consistent security configurations. This is emphasized by the fact that virtual machines are abruptly migrated between physical hosts, in the same or even in different data centers under different security policies. If security is not correctly enforced at the destination locations, and not properly updated in the source locations, security of the migrating virtual machine as well as the co-located machines can be compromised. In this paper, we intend to tackle this problem, specifically for intrusion detection/prevention and VPN/IPsec as main security mechanisms. More precisely, we propose a systematic verification approach to check the compliance of security configurations. To this end, we first elaborate on two properties, namely intrusion monitoring configuration preservation and VPN/IPsec protection configuration preservation. Then, we derive a set of formulas that compare security configurations before and after migration. This allows reasoning on whether the aforementioned security properties hold. To this end, we encode these formulas as constraint satisfaction problems. The obtained constraints are then submitted to a constraint solver, namely Sugar, in order to verify the properties and to pinpoint potential misconfiguration problems.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud storage services and NoSQL systems are optimized for performance and availability. Hence, enterprise-grade features like security mechanisms are typically neglected even though there is a need for them with increased cloud adoption by enterprises. Only Transport Layer Security (TLS) is frequently supported. Furthermore, the standard Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol offers many configuration options which are usually chosen purely based on chance. We argue that in cloud database systems, configuration options should be chosen based on the degree of vulnerability to attacks and security threats as well as on the performance overhead of the respective algorithms. Our contributions are a benchmarking approach for transparent analysis of the performance impact of various TLS configuration options and a custom TLS socket implementation which offers more fine-grained control over the configuration options chosen. We also use our benchmarking approach to study the performance impact of TLS in Amazon DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra.",

            "Abstract": "SilverLine is a novel, exceptionally modular framework for enforcing mandatory information flow policies for Java computations on commodity, data-processing, Platform-as-a-Service clouds by leveraging Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and In-lined Reference Monitors (IRMs). Unlike traditional system-level approaches, which typically require modifications to the cloud kernel software, OS/hypervisor, VM, or cloud file system, SilverLine automatically in-lines secure information flow tracking code into untrusted Java binaries as they arrive at the cloud. This facilitates efficient enforcement of a large, flexible class of information flow and mandatory access control policies without any customization of the cloud or its underlying infrastructure. The cloud and the enforcement framework can therefore be maintained completely separately and orthogonally (i.e., modularly). To demonstrate the approach's feasibility, a prototype implements and deploys SilverLine on a real-world data processing cloud-Hadoop MapReduce. Evaluation results demonstrate that SilverLine provides inter-process information flow security for Hadoop clouds with easy maintainability (through modularity) and low overhead.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud storage services and NoSQL systems typically guarantee only Eventual Consistency. Knowing the degree of inconsistency increases transparency and comparability, it also eases application development. As every change to the system implementation, configuration, and deployment may affect the consistency guarantees of a storage system, long-term experiments are necessary to analyze how consistency behavior evolves over time. Building on our original publication on consistency benchmarking, we describe extensions to our benchmarking approach and report the surprising development of consistency behavior in Amazon S3 over the last two years. Based on our findings, we argue that consistency behavior should be monitored continuously and that deployment decisions should be reconsidered periodically. For this purpose, we propose a new method called Indirect Consistency Monitoring which allows to track all application-relevant changes in consistency behavior in a much more cost-efficient way compared to continuously running consistency benchmarks.",

However, they suffer from inefficient data mobility due to the centralization of cloud resources, and hence, are highly unsuited for dispersed-data-intensive applications, where the data may be spread at multiple geographical locations. In this paper, we present Nebula: a dispersed cloud infrastructure that uses voluntary edge resources for both computation and data storage. We describe the lightweight Nebula architecture that enables distributed data-intensive computing through a number of optimizations including location-aware data and computation placement, replication, and recovery. We evaluate Nebula's performance on an emulated volunteer platform that spans over 50 PlanetLab nodes distributed across Europe, and show how a common data-intensive computing framework, MapReduce, can be easily deployed and run on Nebula. We show Nebula MapReduce is robust to a wide array of failures and substantially outperforms other wide-area versions based on a BOINC like model.",

In this paper, we expand the use of diversification as an analytical tool to explore large datasets dispersed over many nodes. The diversification problem is in general NP-complete and existing uniprocessor algorithms are unfortunately not suitable for the distributed setting of our environment. Using the MapReduce framework we consider two distinct approaches to solve the distributed diversification problem, one that focuses on optimizing disk I/O and one that optimizes for network I/O. Our approaches are iterative in nature, allowing the user to continue refining the diversification process if more time is available. Moreover, we prove that (i) this iteration process converges and (ii) it produces a 2-approximate diversified result set when compared to the optimal solution. We also develop a cost model to predict the run-time for both approaches based on the network and disk characteristics. We implemented our approaches on a cluster of 40 cores and showed that they are scalable and produce the same quality results as the state-of-the-art uniprocessor algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "The automation of application provisioning is one of the most important issues in Cloud Computing. The Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications (TOSCA) supports automating provisioning by two different flavors: (i) declarative processing is based on interpreting application topology models by a runtime that infers provisioning logic whereas (ii) imperative processing employs provisioning plans that explicitly describe the provisioning tasks to be executed. Both flavors come with benefits and drawbacks. This paper presents a means to combine both flavors to resolve drawbacks and to profit from benefits of both worlds: we propose a standards-based approach to generate provisioning plans based on TOSCA topology models. These provisioning plans are workflows that can be executed fully automatically and may be customized by application developers after generation. We prove the technical feasibility of the approach by an end-to-end open source toolchain and evaluate its extensibility, performance, and complexity.",

As a working online digital library search engine, the physical infrastructure of CiteSeerX represents many of the clusters for a typical digital library in terms of size and functionalities. CiteSeerX used to run on a cluster consisting of eighteen loosely coupled physical machines. In this work we share the experiences and lessons learned through migrating CiteSeerX into a private cloud environment using virtualization technique. We also discuss alternative solutions including a public cloud deployment using Amazon EC2 and EBS services. We found that the private cloud via virtualization is a better model for a digital library system like CiteSeerX. We also report system status, activities and proposed variations after the new system has been running for over half a year.",

            "Abstract": "This paper introduces a prototype of Taiwan UniCloud, a community-driven hybrid cloud platform for academics in Taiwan. The goal is to leverage resources in multiple clouds among different organizations. Each self-managing cloud can join the UniCloud platform to share its resources and simultaneously benefit from other clouds with scale-out capabilities. Accordingly, resources are elastic and sharable with each other such as to afford unexpected resource demands to each cloud. The proposed platform provides a web portal to operate each cloud via a uniform user interface. The construction of virtual clusters with multi-core VMs is supplied for parallel and distributed processing models. An object-based storage system is also delivered to federate different storage providers. This paper not only presents the architectural design of Taiwan UniCloud, but also evaluates the performance to demonstrate the possibility of current implementation. Experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed platform as well as the benefit from the cloud federation.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing has emerged as a model for utility computing that promotes on-demand scalability, flexible application deployment and reuse. Software product lines (SPL) promote reusable application development for product families. As any computing system, cloud-based systems evolve to respond to changing clients' requirements. Cloud-based applications can be modeled as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) families similar to the SPL products. As SPL development techniques rely on feature models to describe the commonality and variability of family member applications, such techniques can be used to model variability in SaaS. In this paper, we describe a unified and systematic framework for modeling cloud services in a vendor-neutral manner. In addition, we demonstrate the applicability of the variability framework for building and customizing SaaS multitenant applications. Our approach is based on a meta-model that formalizes the multiple views of service-oriented SaaS applications. A proof of concept tool that automatically generates multitenant applications (to adapt to changing requirements of tenants) is presented. Our approach facilitates development of cloud SaaS families in a systematic, consistent, and platform independent way.",

            "Abstract": "Live migration of virtual machines (VMs) can benefit data centers through load balancing, fault tolerance, energy saving, etc. Although live migration between geographically distributed data centers can enable optimized scheduling of resources in a large area, it remains expensive and difficult to implement. One of the main challenges is transferring the memory state over WAN. There is a conflict between the low data transmission speed over WAN and the rapid change of memory contents. This paper proposes a novel live migration method with page-count-based data deduplication, which takes advantage of the fact that VMs running same or similar operating systems and other software tend to have identical memory pages. Template pages are selected based on number of occurrences of each page across multiple VMs and indexed by content hash. When a memory page is transferred, the source host first compares it with the templates. If a match is identified, the source host transfers the index instead of the data of the memory page. The experimental results show that our approach reduces the migration time by 27% and the data transferred by 38% on average compared to the default method of QEMU-KVM.",

A widely recognized impediment to achieving this goal is so called \"Virtual Machines sprawl\", a phenomenon referring to the situation when customers order Virtual Machines (VM) on the cloud, use them extensively and then leave them inactive for prolonged periods of time. Since a typical cloud provisioning system treats new VM provision requests according to the nominal virtual hardware specification, an often occurring situation is that the nominal resources of a cloud/pool become exhausted fast while the physical hosts utilization remains low.We present a novel cloud resources scheduler called Pulsar that extends OpenStack Nova Filter Scheduler. The key design principle of Pulsar is adaptivity. It recognises that effective safely attainable over-commit ratio varies with time due to workloads' variability and dynamically adapts the effective over-commit ratio to these changes. We evaluate Pulsar via extensive simulations and demonstrate its performance on the actual OpenStack based testbed running popular workloads.",

Process knowledge, however, has rarely been used to predict and decide about cloud infrastructure resource usage. In this paper, we present an approach for BPM-aware cloud computing that builds on process knowledge to improve the timeliness and quality of resource scaling decisions. We introduce an IaaS resource controller based on fuzzy theory that monitors process execution and that is used to predict and control resource requirements for subsequent process tasks. In a laboratory experiment, we evaluate the controller design against a commercially available state-of-the-art auto scaler. Based on the results, we discuss improvements and limitations, and suggest directions for further research.",

This paper explores how virtualized data center performance can be improved when network traffic and topology data informs VM placement. Our practical heuristics, tested on network-heavy, scale-out workloads in an 80 server cluster, improve overall performance by up to 70% compared to random placement in a multi-tenant configuration.",

            "Abstract": "Improving resource provisioning of heterogeneous cloud infrastructures is an important research challenge. The wide diversity of cloud-based applications and customers with different QoS requirements have recently exhibited the weaknesses of current provisioning systems. Today's cloud infrastructures provide provisioning systems that dynamically adapt the computational power of applications by adding or releasing resources. Unfortunately, these scaling systems are fairly limited:(i) They restrict themselves to a single type of resource, (ii)they are unable to fulfill QoS requirements in face of spiky workload, and (iii) they offer the same QoS level to all their customers, independent of customer preferences such as different levels of service availability and performance. In this paper, we present an autoscaling system that overcomes these limitations by exploiting heterogeneous types of resources, and by defining multiple levels of QoS requirements. The proposed system selects a resource scaling plan according to both workload and customer requirements. Our experiments conducted on both public and private infrastructures show significant reductions in QoS-level violations when faced with highly variable workloads.",

Several approaches and tools are available to automate the involved processes. The DevOps community, for example, provides tooling and artifacts to realize deployment automation on Infrastructure as a Service level in a mostly application-oriented manner. Platform as a Service frameworks are also available for the same purpose. In this paper we categorize and characterize available deployment approaches independently from the underlying technology used. For this purpose, we choose Web applications with different technology stacks and analyze their specific deployment requirements. Afterwards, we provision these applications using each of the identified types of deployment approaches in the Cloud. Finally, we discuss the evaluation results and derive recommendations which deployment approach to use based on the deployment requirements of an application.",

            "Abstract": "One of the key benefits of Cloud systems is their ability to provide elastic, on-demand (seemingly infinite) computing capability and performance for supporting service delivery. With the resource availability in single data centres proving to be limited, the option of obtaining extra-resources from a collection of Cloud providers has appeared as an efficacious solution. The ability to utilize resources from multiple Cloud providers is also often mentioned as a means to: (i) prevent vendor lock in, (ii) to enable in house capacity to be combined with an external Cloud provider, (iii) combine specialist capability from multiple Cloud vendors (especially when one vendor does not offer such capability or where such capability may come at a higher price). Such federation of Cloud systems can therefore overcome a limit in capacity and enable providers to dynamically increase the availability of resources to serve requests. We describe and evaluate the establishment of such a federation using a CometCloud based implementation, and consider a number of federation policies with associated scenarios and determine the impact of such policies on the overall status of our system. CometCloud provides an overlay that enables multiple types of Cloud systems (both public and private) to be federated through the use of specialist gateways. We describe how two physical sites, in the UK and the US, can be federated in a seamless way using this system.",

            "Abstract": "Subsampling workloads compute statistics from a set of observed samples using a random subset of sample data (i.e., a subsample). Data-parallel platforms group these samples into tasks, each task subsamples its data in parallel. In this paper, we study subsampling workloads that benefit from tiny tasks-i.e., tasks comprising few samples. Tiny tasks reduce processor cache misses caused by random subsampling, which speeds up per-task running time. However, they can also cause significant scheduling overheads that negate the time reduction from reduced cache misses. For example, vanilla Hadoop takes longer to start tiny tasks than to run them. We compared the task scheduling overheads of vanilla Hadoop, lightweight Hadoop setups, and BashReduce. BashReduce, the best platform, outperformed the worst by 3.6X but scheduling overhead was still 12% of a task's running time. We improved BashReduce's scheduler by allowing it to size tasks according to kneepoints on the miss rate curve. We tested these changes on high-throughput genotype data and on data obtained from Netflix. Our improved BashReduce outperformed vanilla Hadoop by almost 3X and completed short, interactive jobs almost as efficiently as long jobs. These results held at scale and across diverse, heterogeneous hardware.",

            "Abstract": "Accurate and up-to-date knowledge of how a cloud tenant's VMs utilize the underlying cloud infrastructure is essential for many cloud management tasks including tenant onboarding, optimized VM placement, performance optimization, and debugging. Unfortunately, existing solutions such as instrumentation at the hypervisors or standard networking protocols such as LLDP only provide a partial picture of cloud tenant's application structures and how they stress the underlying infrastructure. In this paper, we consider whether it is possible to use sFlow, a standardized mechanism for packet header sampling available in most commodity network switches, to extract such information in an accurate and scalable manner. We overcome the challenges posed by the purely passive and highly sampled nature of sFlow data, and describe a tool, sFinder, that automatically and continuously extracts such information. Our evaluation using sampled sFlow data from a real private cloud show that sFinder is accurate and efficient.",

The existence of virtual machines (VM) that host the components of such applications enables their portability and scalability. VMs are used in cloud infrastructures, and with dynamic operational requirements there is a need to move VMs within and across different clouds. The successful migration of VMs from one cloud to another should not always be considered as given. The goal of this paper is to devise and implement methods and conduct functional tests towards evaluating interoperability in cloud environments. We suggest a methodology for assessing the interoperability across different systems and we conduct a survey with a series of hypervisors and operating systems.",

            "Abstract": "With the proliferation of cloud based services - IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS - enterprises are increasingly consuming all type of IT services delivered by cloud providers. These cloud services are increasingly being used to create integrated solutions where some of the component services are delivered from on-premise private cloud environments and the remaining are provided by off-premise providers. While this best-of-breed approach results in flexible and agile business solutions, it also raises significant problems related to metering, billing, charge back and accounting. In this paper, after reviewing common hybrid cloud integration patterns, we discuss the importance of usage metering and the associated challenges in hybrid cloud environments. We then present a novel solution for metering of services delivered from multiple cloud providers. In this approach, service metering is keyed off of the life-cycle events generated by the service management controls across the hybrid cloud. By identifying life-cycle events associated with services consumed, service usage is tracked from all sources and then filtered and aggregated in a centralized manner. The aggregated information can then be used in an on-line manner for policy-based service delivery, charge-back, billing and reporting, and auditing. Based on this approach we have developed an end-to-end service usage metering and billing system for hybrid cloud environments. Some of the key underlying technologies have been incorporated in IBM SmartCloud Orchestrator - an IBM offering for managing workload patterns in multi cloud environments.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud offers numerous technical middleware services such as databases, caches, messaging systems, and storage but very few business middleware services as first tier managed services. Business middleware such as business process management, business rules, operational decision management, content management and business analytics, if deployed in a cloud environment, is typically only available in a hosted (black-box) model. This is partly due to where cloud is in its evolution, and mostly due to the relatively higher complexity of business middleware vs. technical middleware in the deployment, provisioning, usage, etc. Business middleware consists of multiple functions for business processes design and modeling, execution, optimization, monitoring, and analysis. These functions and their associated complexity have inhibited the wholesale migration of existing business middleware to the cloud. To better understand the complexity in bringing business middleware to the cloud and to develop a systematic cloud enablement approach, we studied the deployment of IBM's Operational Decision Manager (ODM) business middleware product as a managed service (Cloud Decision Service) in IBM's BlueMix cloud platform. Our study indicates that complex middleware must be componentized along functional boundaries, and provide these functions for different business users and developers with cloud experience. In addition, middleware services must leverage other cloud services and they should provide interfaces so that they can be consumed by Java applications as well as by polyglot applications (JavaScript, Ruby, Python, etc). Applications can bind to and use our Cloud Decision Service in a matter of seconds. In contrast, it takes hours to days to setup such a service in the traditional packaged software model. Based on the lessons learned from this experiment we develop a blueprint for enabling high value business middleware as managed cloud services.",

In this paper we present a proof of concept (PoC) project together with industry partners which deals with the management of portable Cloud applications. Experimentation with a multi-tier Cloud application use case gives insights into the capabilities of the TOSCA specification (version 1). To realize support for a Cloud environment based on OpenStack and Opscode Chef, an environment that allows the execution and management of TOSCA service topologies has been developed. For the evaluation of the implemented system, we orchestrate the un-/deployment of the multi-tier Cloud application use case and in the end we discuss the results and experiences of this exercise.",

            "Abstract": "The Cloud attempts to provide its users with automatically scalable platforms to host many applications and operating systems. To allow for quick deployment, they are often homogenised to a few images, restricting the variations used within the Cloud. An exploitable vulnerability stored within an image means that each instance will suffer from it and as a result, an attacker can be sure of a high pay-off for their time. This makes the Cloud a prime target for malicious activities. There is a clear requirement to develop an automated and computationally-inexpensive method of discovering malicious behaviour as soon as it starts, such that remedial action can be adopted before substantial damage is caused. In this paper we propose the use of Mini-OS, a virtualised operating system that uses minimal resources on the Xen virtualisation platform, for analysing the memory space of other guest virtual machines. These detectors, which we call Forensic Virtual Machines (FVMs), are lightweight such that they are inherently computationally cheap to run. Such a small footprint allows the physical host to run numerous instances to find symptoms of malicious behaviour whilst potentially limiting attack vectors. We describe our experience of developing FVMs and how they can be used to complement existing methods to combat malware. We also evaluate them in terms of performance and the resources that they require.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is a new paradigm for the delivery of IT services. It has enabled many promising opportunities for features that cannot be easily implemented in traditional IT environments, such as elastic scalability, self-service deployment, resiliency and recovery, and so forth. Benchmarking the cloud requires a well-defined set of cloud performance metrics that should be able to sensitively distinguish the capabilities of cloud systems that enable those features. One way of defining benchmark metrics is based on observations of the internal mechanisms in a cloud. For example, an elasticity evaluation may be based on measuring a resource provisioning interval in the cloud. However, a more meaningful evaluation should be based on user-centric metrics. In this article, we will introduce a set of performance metrics that can be directly measured, calculated and compared by the cloud users, including workload consumers and the users who deploy and manage the workload life cycles. We will also discuss ways to organize the user-centric metrics, with different emphasis, into a benchmark that represents different use cases.",

            "Abstract": "Graph stores are becoming increasingly popular among NOSQL applications seeking flexibility and heterogeneity in managing linked data. Conceptually and in practice, applications ranging from social networks, knowledge representations to Internet of things benefit from graph data stores built on a combination of relational and non-relational technologies aimed at desired performance characteristics. The most common data access pattern in querying graph stores is to traverse from a node to its neighboring nodes. This paper studies the impact of such traversal pattern to common data caching policies in a partitioned data environment where a big graph is distributed across servers in a cluster. We propose and evaluate a new graph aware caching policy designed to keep and evict nodes, edges and their metadata optimized for query traversal pattern. The algorithm distinguishes the topology of the graph as well as the latency of access to the graph nodes and neighbors. We implemented graph aware caching on a distributed data store Apache HBase in the Hadoop family. Performance evaluations showed up to 15x speedup on the benchmark datasets preferring our new graph aware policy over non-aware policies. We also show how to improve the performance of existing caching algorithms for distributed graphs by exploiting the topology information.",

            "Abstract": "Frequent Item set Mining (FIM) is a classic data mining topic with many real world applications such as market basket analysis. Many algorithms including Apriori, FP-Growth, and Eclat were proposed in the FIM field. As the dataset size grows, researchers have proposed MapReduce version of FIM algorithms to meet the big data challenge. This paper proposes new improvements to the MapReduce implementation of FIM algorithm by introducing a cache layer and a selective online analyzer. We have evaluated the effectiveness and efficiency of Smart Cache via extensive experiments on four public datasets. Smart Cache can reduce on average 45.4%, and up to 97.0% of the total execution time compared with the state-of-the-art solution.",

We explore the use of cloud infrastructure to optimize content-centric mobile applications, which can have high communication and storage requirements, based on the analysis of user activity. We present two specific optimizations, precaching and prefetching, as well as the design and implementation of a middleware framework that allows mobile application developers to easily utilize these techniques. Our framework is fully generalizable to any content-centric mobile application, a large and growing class of Internet applications. A news aggregation application is used as a case study to evaluate our implementation. We make use of a cosine similarity scheme to identify users with similar interests, which in turn is used to determine what content to prefetch. Various cache algorithms, implemented for our framework, are also considered. A workload trace and simulation are used to measure the performance of the application and framework. We observe a dramatic improvement in application performance due to use of our framework with a reasonable amount of overhead. Our system also significantly outperforms a baseline implementation that performs the same optimizations without taking user activity into account.",

            "Abstract": "Today the cloud-desktop service, or Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS), is massively replacing Virtual Desktop Infrastructures (VDI), as confirmed by the importance of players entering the DaaS market. In this paper we study the workload of a DaaS provider, analyzing three months of real traffic and resource usage. What emerges from the study, the first on the subject at the best of our knowledge, is that the workload on CPU and disk usage are long-tail distributed (lognormal, weibull and pare to) and that the length of working sessions is exponentially distributed. These results are extremely important for: the selection of the appropriate performance model to be used in capacity planning or run-time resource provisioning, the setup of workload generators, and the definition of heuristic policies for resource provisioning. The paper provides an accurate distribution fitting for all the workload features considered and discusses the implications of results on performance analysis.",
            "TLDR": "This paper studies the workload of a DaaS provider, analyzing three months of real traffic and resource usage and concludes that the workload on CPU and disk usage are long-tail distributed and that the length of working sessions is exponentially distributed."

A middleware that is comprised of a set of HA agents is defined to compensate the limitations of Linux containers in achieving HA. In our approach we start modeling at the application level, considering the dependencies among application components. We generate the proper scheduling scheme and then deploy the application across containers in the cloud. For each container that hosts critical component(s), we continuously monitor its status and checkpoint its full state, and then react to its failure by restarting locally or failing over to another host where we resume the computing from the most recent state. By using this strategy, all components hosted in a container are preserved without intrusively imposing modification on the application side. Finally, the feasibility of our approach is verified by building a proof-of-concept prototype and a case study of a video streaming application.",

            "Abstract": "Platform as a service (PaaS) is a cloud delivery model that provides software services and solution stacks to enable rapid development, deployment, and operations in many languages and run-times (polyglot). These applications require capabilities to rapidly grow and shrink the underlying resources to satisfy their workload needs. Auto scaling is a service that enables dynamic resource allocation and deal location to match application performance needs and service level agreements. In this paper we present the architecture and implementation of a polyglot auto scaling solution for IBM Blue mix PaaS. Our auto scaling service enables users to describe policies and set thresholds for scaling the applications based on CPU, memory and heap usage for applications developed in different languages (Java, Java Script, Ruby, etc). The auto scaling service consists of a set of monitoring agents, monitoring service, scaling service, and a persistence service. The service is developed with sharedmulti-tenancy model and offered as a managed cloud service. An application attached to the auto scaling service is monitored and its resources will be adjusted based on the auto scaling policies of the user and on the system conditions.",

            "Abstract": "Emergence and adoption of cloud computing have become widely prevalent given the value proposition it brings to an enterprise in terms of agility and cost effectiveness. Big data analytical capabilities (specifically treating storage/system management as a big data problem for a service provider) using Cloud delivery models is defined as Analytics as a Service or Software as a Service. This service simplifies obtaining useful insights from an operational enterprise data center leading to cost and performance optimizations.Software defined environments decouple the control planes from the data planes that were often vertically integrated in a traditional networking or storage systems. The decoupling between the control planes and the data planes enables opportunities for improved security, resiliency and IT optimization in general. This talk describes our novel approach in hosting the systems management platform (a.k.a. control plane) in the cloud offered to enterprises in Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Specifically, in this presentation, focus is on the analytics layer with SaaS paradigm enabling data centers to visualize, optimize and forecast infrastructure via a simple capture, analyze and govern framework. At the core, it uses big data analytics to extract actionable insights from system management metrics data. Our system is developed in research and deployed across customers, where core focus is on agility, elasticity and scalability of the analytics framework. We demonstrate few system/storage management analytics case studies to demonstrate cost and performance optimization for both cloud consumer as well as service provider. Actionable insights generated from the analytics platform are implemented in an automated fashion via an OpenStack based platform.",

Thus, significant effort is made in these stacks to partition the data into small chunks, and process these chunks in parallel. Recent advances in memory technology now promise the availability of machines with the amount of memory increased by two or more orders of magnitude. For example, The Machine [1] currently under development at HP Labs plans to use memristor, a new type of non-volatile random access memory with much larger memory density at access speed comparable to today's dynamic random access memory. Such technologies offer the possibility of a flat memory/storage hierarchy, in-memory data processing and instant persistence of intermediate and final processing results. Photonic fabrics provide large communication bandwidth to move large volume of data between processing units at very low latency. Moreover, the multicore architectures adopt system-on-chip (SoC) designs to achieve significant compute performance with high power-efficiency.",

            "Abstract": "The main quest for cloud stakeholders is to find an optimal deployment architecture for cloud applications that maximizes availability, minimizes cost, and addresses portability and scalability. Unfortunately, the lack of a unified definition and adequate modeling language and methodologies that address the cloud domain specific characteristics makes architecting efficient cloud applications a daunting task. This paper introduces Stratus ML: a technology agnostic integrated modeling framework for cloud applications. Stratus ML provides an intuitive user interface that allows the cloud stakeholders (i.e., providers, developers, administrators, and financial decision makers) to define their application services, configure them, specify the applications' behaviour at runtime through a set of adaptation rules, and estimate cost under diverse cloud platforms and configurations. Moreover, through a set of model transformation templates, Stratus ML maintains consistency between the various artifacts of cloud applications. This paper presents Stratus ML and illustrates its usefulness and practical applicability from different stakeholder perspectives. A demo video, usage scenario and other relevant information can be found at the Stratus ML webpage.",

            "Abstract": "Applications on cloud infrastructures acquire virtual machines (VMs) from providers when necessary. The current interface for acquiring VMs from most providers, however, is too limiting for the tenants, in terms of granularity in which VMs can be acquired (e.g., small, medium, large, etc.), while giving very limited control over their placement. The former leads to VM underutilization, and the latter has performance implications, both translating into higher costs for the tenants. In this work, we leverage nested virtualization and a networking overlay to tackle these problems. We present Kangaroo, an Open Stack-based virtual infrastructure provider, and IPOPsm, a virtual networking switch for communication between nested VMs over different infrastructure VMs. In addition, we design and implement Skippy, the realization of our proposed virtual infrastructure API for programming Kangaroo. Our benchmarks show that through careful mapping of nested VMs to infrastructure VMs, Kangaroo achieves up to an order of magnitude better performance, with only half the cost on Amazon EC2. Further, Kangaroo's unified Open Stack API allows us to migrate an entire application between Amazon EC2 and our local Open Nebula deployment within a few minutes, without any downtime or modification to the application code.",
            "TLDR": "This work presents Kangaroo, an Open Stack-based virtual infrastructure provider, and IPOPsm, a virtual networking switch for communication between nested VMs over different infrastructure VMs, and designs and implements Skippy, the realization of the proposed virtual infrastructure API for programming Kangaroo."

            "Abstract": "Big data processing is one of the killer applications for cloud systems. MapReduce systems such as Hadoop are the most popular big data processing platforms used in the cloud system. Data corruption is one of the most critical problems in cloud data processing, which not only has serious impact on the integrity of individual application results but also affects the performance and availability of the whole data processing system. In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on 138 real world data corruption incidents reported in Hadoop bug repositories. We characterize those data corruption problems in four aspects: 1) what impact can data corruption have on the application and system? 2) how is data corruption detected? 3) what are the causes of the data corruption? and 4) what problems can occur while attempting to handle data corruption? Our study has made the following findings: 1) the impact of data corruption is not limited to data integrity, 2) existing data corruption detection schemes are quite insufficient: only 25% of data corruption problems are correctly reported, 42% are silent data corruption without any error message, and 21% receive imprecise error report. We also found the detection system raised 12% false alarms, 3) there are various causes of data corruption such as improper runtime checking, race conditions, inconsistent block states, improper network failure handling, and improper node crash handling, and 4) existing data corruption handling mechanisms (i.e., data replication, replica deletion, simple re-execution) make frequent mistakes including replicating corrupted data blocks, deleting uncorrupted data blocks, or causing undesirable resource hogging.",
            "TLDR": "A comprehensive study on 138 real world data corruption incidents reported in Hadoop bug repositories finds the impact of data corruption is not limited to data integrity, and existing data corruption detection schemes are quite insufficient."

            "Abstract": "Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) generally provides a standard vanilla server that contains an OS and basic functions, and each user has to manually install the required applications for the proper server deployments. We are working on a composite application deployment approach to automatically install selected applications in a flexible manner, based on a set of application installation scripts that are invoked on the vanilla server. Some applications have installation dependencies involving multiple servers. Previous research projects on installing applications with multi-server dependencies have deployed the servers sequentially. This means the total deployment time grows linearly with the number of servers. Our automated parallel approach makes the composite application deployment run in parallel when there are installation dependencies across multiple servers. We implemented a prototype system on Chef, a widely used automatic server installation framework, and evaluated the performance of our composite application deployment on a Soft Layer public cloud using two composite application server cases. The deployment times were reduced by roughly 40% in our trials.",

Due to increasing demand for additional resources there is a clear need to adapt these applications to the distributed environments. However, this is not an easy task and numerous variants are possible. Moreover, in this transition a new quality requirements become important, such as application elasticity. Application elasticity has to be built into a software system to enable smooth cost optimization at the run-time. In this paper, we provide a framework for evaluating different transformation variants of vertical Java EE multi-tiered applications into elastic cloud applications. With support of this framework the software developer is guided how to transform its application achieving optimal elasticity strategy. The framework is evaluated on slicing and evaluating elasticity of existing SaaS multi-tiered Java application used in Croatian market.",

            "Abstract": "With the rapid growth of dataset, more and more traditional applications turn into big data applications running on cloud platforms. This trend has continued, and even accelerated. Compared with traditional applications, big data applications spend lots of time to transfer data among computing nodes. Hence, the communication optimization is a must for big data applications. Network topology and routing algorithm of the underlying system are two major factors in determining the communication performance of big data applications. Once the system is deployed, the network topology is fixed and static or dynamic routing protocols are preinstalled. Users cannot change them. Therefore, it is hard for application developers to identify the optimal network configuration for their applications with distinct communication patterns. In this study, we design a flexible container-based tuning system (Flex Tuner) allowing users to create a farm of lightweight virtual machines (containers) on host machines. In addition, we use software-defined networking (SDN) technique to connect and direct the network traffic among these containers. Users can soft-tune the network topology and network traffic of the Flex Tuner, thereby enabling application developers to analyze their applications on the same system with different network configuration. The preliminary experimental results have shown that Flex Tuner can represent application performance variations caused by network topology and routing algorithm. Case studies through both synthetic big data programs and benchmarks have indicated that Flex Tuner enables researchers to analyze the communication cost of their big data applications and to find the suitable network topology and routing algorithm.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud providers must detect malicious traffic in and out of their network, virtual or otherwise. The use of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) has been hampered by the encryption of network communication. The result is that current signatures cannot match potentially malicious requests. A method to acquire the encryption keys is Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI). VMI is a technique to view the internal, and yet raw, representation of a Virtual Machine (VM). Current methods to find keys are expensive and use sliding windows or entropy. This inevitably requires reading the memory space of the entire process, or worse the OS, in a live environment where performance is paramount. This paper describes a structured walk of memory to find keys, particularly RSA, using as fewer reads from the VM as possible. In doing this we create a scalable mechanism to populate an IDS with keys to analyse traffic.",
            "TLDR": "A structured walk of memory to find keys, particularly RSA, using as fewer reads from the VM as possible is described, which creates a scalable mechanism to populate an IDS with keys to analyse traffic."

            "Abstract": "Existing Searchable Encryption (SE) solutions are able to handle simple boolean search queries, such as single or multi-keyword queries, but cannot handle substring search queries over encrypted data that also involves identifying the position of the substring within the document. These types of queries are relevant in areas such as searching DNA data. In this paper, we propose a tree-based Substring Position Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSP-SSE) to overcome the existing gap. Our solution efficiently finds occurrences of a substrings over encrypted cloud data. We formally define the leakage functions and security properties of SSP-SSE. Then, we prove that the proposed scheme is secure against chosen-keyword attacks that involve an adaptive adversary. Our analysis demonstrates that SSP-SSE introduces very low overhead on computation and storage.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes a tree-based Substring Position Searchable Symmetric Encryption (SSP-SSE), and proves that the proposed scheme is secure against chosen-keyword attacks that involve an adaptive adversary."

            "Abstract": "We initiate the study of the following problem: Suppose Alice and Bob would like to outsource their encrypted private data sets to the cloud, and they also want to conduct the set intersection operation on their plaintext data sets. The straightforward solution for them is to download their outsourced cipher texts, decrypt the cipher texts locally, and then execute a commodity two-party set intersection protocol. Unfortunately, this solution is not practical. We therefore motivate and introduce the novel notion of Verifiable Delegated Set Intersection on outsourced encrypted data (VDSI). The basic idea is to delegate the set intersection operation to the cloud, while (i) not giving the decryption capability to the cloud, and (ii) being able to hold the misbehaving cloud accountable. We formalize security properties of VDSI and present a construction. In our solution, the computational and communication costs on the users are linear to the size of the intersection set, meaning that the efficiency is optimal up to a constant factor.",

            "Abstract": "In this work we present Scalable Attestation, a method which combines both secure boot and trusted boot technologies, and extends them up into the host, its programs, and up into the guest's operating system and workloads, to both detect and prevent integrity attacks. Anchored in hardware, this integrity appraisal and attestation protects persistent data (files) from remote attack, even if the attack is root privileged. As an added benefit of a hardware rooted attestation, we gain a simple hardware based geolocation attestation to help enforce regulatory requirements. This design is implemented in multiple cloud test beds based on the QEMU/KVM hypervisor, Open Stack, and Open Attestation, and is shown to provide significant additional integrity protection at negligible cost.",

            "Abstract": "Today, cloud computing engines such as stream-processing Storm and batch-processing Hadoop are being increasingly run atop software-defined networks (SDNs). In such cloud stacks, the scheduler of the application engine (which allocates tasks to servers) remains decoupled from the SDN scheduler (which allocates network routes). We propose a new approach that performs cross-layer scheduling between the application layer and the networking layer. This coordinated scheduling orchestrates the placement of application tasks (e.g., Hadoop maps and reduces, or Storm bolts) in tandem with the selection of network routes that arise from these tasks. We present results from both cluster deployment and simulation, and using two representative network topologies: Fat-tree and Jellyfish. Our results show that cross-layer scheduling can improve throughput of Hadoop and Storm by between 26% to 34% in a 30-host cluster, and it scales well.",
            "TLDR": "This work proposes a new approach that performs cross-layer scheduling between the application layer and the networking layer that can improve throughput of Hadoop and Storm by between 26% to 34% in a 30-host cluster, and it scales well."

            "Abstract": "Similar to memory or disk fragmentation in personal computers, emerging \"virtual desktop cloud\" (VDC) services experience the problem of data center resource fragmentation which occurs due to on-the-fly provisioning of virtual desktop (VD) resources. Irregular resource holes due to fragmentation lead to sub-optimal VD resource allocations, and cause: (a)decreased user quality of experience (QoE), and (b) increased operational costs for VDC service providers. In this paper, we address this problem by developing a novel, optimal \"Market-Driven Provisioning and Placement\" (MDPP) scheme that is based upon distributed optimization principles. The MDPP scheme channelizes inherent distributed nature of the resource allocation problem by capturing VD resource bids via a virtual market to explore soft spots in the problem space, and consequently defragments a VDC through cost-aware utility-maximal VD re-allocations or migrations. Through extensive simulations of VD request allocations to multiple data centers for diverse VD application and user QoE profiles, we demonstrate that our MDPP scheme outperforms existing schemes that are largely based on centralized optimization principles. Moreover, MDPP scheme can achieve high VDC performance and scalability, measurable in terms of a 'Net Utility' metric, even when VD resource location constraints are imposed to meet orthogonal security objectives.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years, researchers have contributed promising new techniques for allocating cloud resources in more robust, efficient, and ecologically sustainable ways. Unfortunately, the wide-spread use of these techniques in production systems has, to date, remained elusive. One reason for this is that the state of the art for investigating these innovations at scale often relies solely on model-driven simulation. Production-grade cloud software, however, demands certainty and precision for development and business planning that only comes from validating simulation against empirical observation. In this work, we take an alternative approach to facilitating cloud research and engineering in order to transition innovations to production deployment faster. In particular, we present a new methodology that complements existing model-driven simulation with platform-specific and statistically trustworthy results. We simulate systems at scales and on time frames that are testable, and then, based on the statistical validation of these simulations, investigate scenarios beyond those feasibly observable in practice. We demonstrate the approach by developing an energy-aware cloud scheduler and evaluating it using production and synthetic traces in faster than real time. Our results show that we can accurately simulate a production IaaS system, ease capacity planning, and expedite the reliable development of its components and extensions.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud providers face the challenge of efficiently managing their infrastructure through minimizing resource consumption while allocating requests such that their profit is maximized. We address this challenge by designing a greedy approximation algorithm for solving the multi-resource sharing-aware virtual machine maximization (MSAVMM) problem. The MSAVMM problem requires determining the set of VMs that can be instantiated on a given server such that the profit derived from hosting the VMs is maximized. The solution to this problem has to consider the sharing of memory pages among VMs and the restricted capacities of each type of resource requested by the VMs. We analyze the performance of the proposed algorithm by determining its approximation ratio and by performing extensive experiments against other sharing-aware VM allocation algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "Interests have been growing in integrating renewable energy into data centers, which attracts many research efforts in developing green-aware algorithms and systems. However, little attention was paid to the efficiency of each joule consumed by data center workloads. In fact, not all joules are equal in the sense that the amount of work that can be done by a joule can vary significantly in data centers. Ignoring this fact leads to significant energy waste (by 25% of the total energy consumption in Hadoop YARN on a Facebook production trace according to our study). In this paper, we investigate how to exploit such joule efficiency to maximize the benefits of renewable energy for MapReduce framework. We develop job/task scheduling algorithms with a particular focus on the factors on joule efficiency in the data center, including the energy efficiency of MapReduce workloads, renewable energy supply and the battery usage. We further develop a simple yet effective performance-energy consumption model to guide our scheduling decisions. We have implemented GreenMR, an energy-efficient and green-aware MapReduce framework, on top of Hadoop YARN. The experiments demonstrate the accuracy of our models, and the effectiveness of our energy-efficient and green-aware optimizations over Hadoop YARN and a state-ofthe-art green-aware Hadoop YARN implementation.",

            "Abstract": "While distributed graph processing engines have become popular for processing large graphs, these engines are typically configured with a static set of servers in the cluster. In other words, they lack the flexibility to scale-out or scale-in the number of servers, when requested to do so by the user. In this paper, we propose the first techniques to make distributed graph processing truly elastic. While supporting on-demand scale-out/in operations, we meet three goals: i) perform scale-out/in without interrupting the graph computation, ii) minimize the background network overhead involved in the scale-out/in, and iii) mitigate stragglers by maintaining load balance across servers. We present and analyze two techniques called Contiguous Vertex Repartitioning (CVR) and Ring-based Vertex Repartitioning (RVR) to address these goals. We implement our techniques in the LFGraph distributed graph processing system, and incorporate several systems optimizations. Experiments performed with multiple graph benchmark applications on a real graph indicate that our techniques perform within 9% and 21% of the optimum for scale-out and scale-in operations, respectively.",

We present Stela (STream processing ELAsticity), a stream processing system that supports scale-out and scale-in operations in an on-demand manner, i.e., when the user requests such a scaling operation. Stela meets two goals: 1) it optimizes post-scaling throughput, and 2) it minimizes interruption to the ongoing computation while the scaling operation is being carried out. We have integrated Stela into Apache Storm. We present experimental results using micro-benchmark Storm applications, as well as production applications from industry (Yahoo! Inc. and IBM). Our experiments show that compared to Apache Storm's default scheduler, Stela's scale-out operation achieves throughput that is 21-120% higher, and interruption time that is significantly smaller. Stela's scale-in operation chooses the right set of servers to remove and achieves 2X-5X higher throughput than Storm's default strategy.",

            "Abstract": "Today, many organizations need to operate on data that is distributed around the globe. This is inevitable due to the nature of data that is generated in different locations such as video feeds from distributed cameras, log files from distributed servers, and many others. Although centralized cloud platforms have been widely used for data-intensive applications, such systems are not suitable for processing geo-distributed data due to high data transfer overheads. An alternative approach is to use an Edge Cloud which reduces the network cost of transferring data by distributing its computations globally. While the Edge Cloud is attractive for geo-distributed data-intensive applications, extending existing cluster computing frameworks to a wide-area environment must account for locality. We propose Awan : a new locality-aware resource manager for geo-distributed data-intensive applications. Awan allows resource sharing between multiple computing frameworks while enabling high locality scheduling within each framework. Our experiments with the Nebula Edge Cloud on PlanetLab show that Awan achieves up to a 28% increase in locality scheduling which reduces the average job turnaround time by approximately 18% compared to existing cluster management mechanisms.",

            "Abstract": "With the rapid increase in uptake of cloud services, issues of data management are becoming increasingly prominent. There is a clear, outstanding need for the ability for specified policy to control and track data as it flows throughout cloud infrastructure, to ensure that those responsible for data are meeting their obligations. This paper introduces Information Flow Audit, an approach for tracking information flows within cloud infrastructure. This builds upon CamFlow (Cambridge Flow Control Architecture), a prototype implementation of our model for data-centric security in PaaS clouds. CamFlow enforces Information Flow Control policy both intra-machine at the kernel-level, and inter-machine, on message exchange. Here we demonstrate how CamFlow can be extended to provide data-centric audit logs akin to provenance metadata in a format in which analyses can easily be automated through the use of standard graph processing tools. This allows detailed understanding of the overall system. Combining a continuously enforced data-centric security mechanism with meaningful audit empowers tenants and providers to both meet and demonstrate compliance with their data management obligations.",

            "Abstract": "In the context of private datacenters that are operated by Web service providers such as Google, multiple applications using data parallel frameworks, such as MapReduce, coexist and share a limited supply of link bandwidth capacities. It has been shown that failures are the norm, rather than the exception, in datacenters, and will negatively affect the performance of data parallel applications as failed tasks need to be relaunched and placed on newly selected servers. In this paper, we argue that even with the presence of failures, link bandwidth should be allocated to competing applications with performance-centric fairness, in that the performance that applications enjoy should be proportional to their weights. We formulate and solve the open challenge of jointly optimizing placement decisions for relaunched tasks and bandwidth allocation, so that the adverse effects of failures on application performance are minimized. With our proposed algorithm implemented in the Mininet emulation testbed, our experiments show the effectiveness of our solutions towards minimizing the negative effects of failures, while still achieving performance-centric fairness.",

            "Abstract": "Problem diagnosis is one crucial aspect in the cloud operation that is becoming increasingly challenging. On the one hand, the volume of logs generated in today's cloud is overwhelmingly large. On the other hand, cloud architecture becomes more distributed and complex, which makes it more difficult to troubleshoot failures. In order to address these challenges, we have developed a tool, called LOGAN, that enables operators to quickly identify the log entries that potentially lead to the root cause of a problem. It constructs behavioral reference models from logs that represent the normal patterns. When problem occurs, our tool enables operators to inspect the divergence of current logs from the reference model and highlight logs likely to contain the hints to the root cause. To support these capabilities we have designed and developed several mechanisms. First, we developed log correlation algorithms using various IDs embedded in logs to help identify and isolate log entries that belong to the failed request. Second, we provide efficient log comparison to help understand the differences between different executions. Finally we designed mechanisms to highlight critical log entries that are likely to contain information pertaining to the root cause of the problem. We have implemented the proposed approach in a popular cloud management system, OpenStack, and through case studies, we demonstrate this tool can help operators perform problem diagnosis quickly and effectively.",
            "TLDR": "A tool, called LOGAN, that enables operators to quickly identify the log entries that potentially lead to the root cause of a problem and constructs behavioral reference models from logs that represent the normal patterns, which can help operators perform problem diagnosis quickly and effectively."

            "Abstract": "Modern science and engineering require increasingly sophisticated information technology (IT) for data analysis, simulation, and related tasks. Yet the small to medium laboratories (SMLs) in which the majority of research advances occur increasingly lack the human and financial capital needed to acquire and operate such IT. New methods are needed to provide all researchers with access to state-of-the-art scientific capabilities, regardless of their location and budget. Industry has demonstrated the value of cloud-hosted software-and platform-as-a-service approaches, small businesses that outsource their IT to third-party providers slash costs and accelerate innovation. However, few business cloud services are transferable to science. We thus propose the Discovery Cloud, an ecosystem of new, community-produced services to which SMLs can outsource common activities, from data management and analysis to collaboration and experiment automation. We explain the need for a Discovery Platform to streamline the creation and operation of new and interoperable services, and a Discovery Exchange to facilitate the use and sustainability of Discovery Cloud services. We report on our experiences building early elements of the Discovery Platform in the form of Globus services, and on the experiences of those who have applied those services in innovative applications.",

            "Abstract": "Scalable applications deployed in public clouds can be built from a combination of custom software components and public cloud services. To meet performance and/or cost requirements, such applications can scale-out/in their components during run-time. When higher performance is required, new component instances can be deployed on newly allocated cloud services (e.g., virtual machines). When the instances are no longer needed, their services can be deallocated to decrease cost. However, public cloud services are usually billed over predefined time and/or usage intervals, e.g., per hour, per GB of I/O. Thus, it might not be cost efficient to scale-in public cloud applications at any moment in time, without considering their billing cycles. In this work we aid developers of scalable applications for public clouds to monitor their costs, and develop cost-aware scalability controllers. We introduce a model for capturing the pricing schemes of cloud services. Based on the model we determine and evaluate the application's costs depending on its used cloud services and their billing cycles. We further evaluate cost efficiency of cloud applications, analyzing which application component is cost efficient to deallocate and when. We evaluate our approach on a scalable platform for IoT, deployed in Flexiant, one of the leading European public cloud providers. We show that cost-aware scalability can achieve higher application stability and performance, while reducing its operation costs.",

            "Abstract": "Computation-as-a-Service (CaaS) offerings have gained traction in the last few years due to their effectiveness in balancing between the scalability of Software-as-a-Service and the customisation possibilities of Infrastructure-as-a-Service platforms. To function effectively, a CaaS platform must have three key properties: (i) reactive assignment of individual processing tasks to available cloud instances (compute units) according to availability and predetermined time-to-completion (TTC) constraints, (ii) accurate resource prediction, (iii) efficient control of the number of cloud instances servicing workloads, in order to optimize between completing workloads in a timely fashion and reducing resource utilization costs. In this paper, we propose three approaches that satisfy these properties (respectively): (i) a service rate allocation mechanism based on proportional fairness and TTC constraints, (ii) Kalman-filter estimates for resource prediction, and (iii) the use of additive increase multiplicative decrease (AIMD) algorithms (famous for being the resource management in the transport control protocol) for the control of the number of compute units servicing workloads. The integration of our three proposals into a single CaaS platform is shown to provide for more than 27% reduction in Amazon EC2 spot instance cost against methods based on reactive resource prediction and 38% to 60% reduction of the billing cost against the current state-of-the-art in CaaS platforms (Amazon Lambda and Autoscale).",
            "TLDR": "Three approaches that satisfy three key properties of a CaaS platform are proposed, including a service rate allocation mechanism based on proportional fairness and TTC constraints, Kalman-filter estimates for resource prediction, and the use of additive increase multiplicative decrease algorithms for the control of the number of compute units servicing workloads."

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, cloud computing providers offer idle resources through an auction-based system in order to maximize resource utilization and economical revenue. Cloud computing consumers have the opportunity to take advantage of the resources offered at very low spot price in exchange for lower reliability in the provision of these resources. In this context, the Spot Price Prediction (SPP) is a well studied problem mainly formulated as a time series prediction, with particularities of auction-based cloud markets. This work presents a comparative evaluation of three different well-known prediction algorithms, applied for the first time to the SPP problem, against astate-of-the-art Three-Layer Perceptron (TLP) algorithm. In order to measure the accuracy of the evaluated algorithms, the following error metrics were considered: (1) Mean-Squared Error (2) Maximum Positive Error and (3) Mean Positive Error. Experimental results indicate that the Support Vector Poly Kernel Regression (SMOReg) algorithm outperforms other evaluated algorithms for the SPP problem, improving probabilities of obtaining resources in a highly dynamic spot market.",

            "Abstract": "Unforeseen events such as node failures and resource contention can have a severe impact on the performance of data processing frameworks, such as Hadoop, especially in cloud environments where such incidents are common. SLA compliance in the presence of such events requires the ability to quickly and dynamically resize infrastructure resources. Unfortunately, the distributed and stateful nature of data processing frameworks makes it challenging to accurately scale the system at run-time. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a model-driven autoscaling solution for Hadoop clusters. We first develop novel gray-box performance models for Hadoop workloads that specifically relate job execution times to resource allocation and workload parameters. We then employ these models to dynamically determine the resources required to successfully complete the Hadoop jobs as per the user-specified SLA under various scenarios including node failures and multi-job executions. Our experimental results on three different Hadoop cloud clusters and across different workloads demonstrate the efficacy of our models and highlight their autoscaling capabilities.",

UIE employs queueing theory to model the impact of resource contention on application performance.

However traditional cloud provisioning mechanisms that make local scaling decisions are not well suited for temporal and spatial workload fluctuations seen by modern web applications. In this paper, we argue the need of geo-elasticity and present GeoScale, a system to provide geo-elasticity in distributed clouds. We describe GeoScale's model-driven proactive provisioning approach and conduct an initial evaluation of GeoScale on Amazon's distributed EC2 cloud. Our results show up to 31% improvement in the 95th percentile response time when compared to traditional elasticity techniques.",

            "Abstract": "Existing partial geo-replication systems do not always provide optimal cost or latency, because their replication decisions are based on statically established data access popularity metrics, regardless of the application types. We demonstrate that additional reduction in cost and latency can be achieved by (1) using the right object attributes for making replication decisions for each type of application, (2) using multi-attribute-based replications, and (3) combining the popularity-based but reactive approach with the more random but proactive approach to data replication. Toward this end, we propose Acorn, an Attribute-based COntinuous partial geo-ReplicatioN system, and its prototype implementation based on Apache Cassandra. Experiments with two types of global-scale, data-sharing applications demonstrate up to 54% and 90% cost overhead reduction over existing systems or 38% and 91% latency overhead reduction.",

In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning-based power management framework for data centers, which does not rely on any given stationary assumptions of the job arrival and job service processes. By carefully designing the state space, the action space, and the reward of a learning process, the objective of the reinforcement learning agent coincides with our goal of reducing the server pool energy consumption with reasonable average job response time. Real Google cluster data traces are used to verify the effectiveness of the proposed reinforcement learning-based data center power management framework.",

            "Abstract": "To effectively manage cloud based services, organizations need to continuously monitor the performance metrics listed in the Cloud service contracts. However, these legal documents, like Service Level Agreements (SLA) or privacy policy documents, are currently managed as plain text files meant principally for human consumption. Additionally, providers often define their own performance metrics for their services. These factors hinder the automation of SLA management and require manual effort to monitor the cloud service performance. We have significantly automated the process of extracting, managing and monitoring cloud SLA using natural language processing techniques and Semantic Web technologies. In this paper, we describe our technical approach and the ontology that we have developed to describe, manage, and reason about cloud SLAs. We also describe the prototype system that we have developed to automatically extract information from legal Terms of Service that are available on cloud provider websites.",

            "Abstract": "Appealing features of cloud services motivate consumers to migrate their core businesses to them. However, there are challenges about security, privacy, and compliance. Building compliant systems is difficult because of the complex nature of regulations and cloud systems. In addition, the lack of reference architectures (RAs) makes compliance even harder. RAs should be complete, precise, abstract, vendor neutral, platform independent, with no implementation details, however, their levels of detail and abstraction are still debatable and there is no accepted definition about what an RA should contain. Existing approaches used to build RAs lack structured templates and systematic procedures. In addition, most approaches do not take full advantage of patterns and best practices that promote architectural qualities such as modularity, reusability, flexibility and usability. We propose here a five-step approach to build an RA that can improve the quality of the concrete architectures derived from it and from which we can derive more specialized RAs. These RAs take advantage of patterns and best practices that promote software quality.",

            "Abstract": "In production datacenters operated by Web service providers such as Google, multiple data parallel applications, such as MapReduce, are employed to facilitate data processing at a large scale, with a strong demand for intra-datacenter bandwidth in their communication stages. A noteworthy phenomenon in these applications is the presence of barriers, which implies that a job will not finish until the last task completes. Existing flow-level sharing in datacenter networks is not designed and optimized to meet such application-level needs. In this paper, we promote the awareness of application barriers in the design of both bandwidth allocation and path selection strategies. In particular, we propose the notion of application-level fairness when bandwidth is allocated, with favorable properties of performance-centric max-min fairness and Pareto efficiency. Further, we show that both application-level performance and resource utilization can be further improved by considering path selection as well. With our implementation in the Mininet emulation testbed and large-scale simulations, we demonstrate that our new barrier-aware strategy for fair bandwidth sharing and path selection significantly outperforms barrier-agnostic strategy when application performance is concerned.",

            "Abstract": "Traffic for a typical MapReduce job in a data center consists of multiple network flows. Traditionally, network resources have been allocated to optimize network-level metrics such as flow completion time or throughput. Some recent schemes propose using application-aware scheduling which can shorten the average job completion time. However, most of them treat the core network as a black box with sufficient capacity. Even if only one network link in the core network becomes a bottleneck, it can hurt application performance. We design and implement a centralized flow-scheduling framework called Phurti with the goal of improving the completion time for jobs in a cluster shared among multiple Hadoop jobs (multi-tenant). Phurti communicates both with the Hadoop framework to retrieve job-level network traffic information and the OpenFlow-based switches to learn about the network topology. Phurti implements a novel heuristic called Smallest Maximum Sequential-traffic First (SMSF) that uses collected application and network information to perform traffic scheduling for MapReduce jobs. Our evaluation with real Hadoop workloads shows that compared to application and network-agnostic scheduling strategies, Phurti improves job completion time for 95% of the jobs, decreases average job completion time by 20%, tail job completion time by 13% and scales well with the cluster size and number of jobs.",

            "Abstract": "A large portion of today's Internet traffic originates from streaming and video services. Such services rely on a combination of distributed datacenters, powerful content delivery networks (CDN), and multi-level caching. In spite of this infrastructure, storing, indexing, and serving these videos remains adaily engineering challenge that requires increasing efforts on the part of providers and ISPs. In this paper, we explore how the tags attached to videos by users could help improve this infrastructure, and lead to better performance on a global scale. Our analysis shows that tags can be interpreted as markers of a video's geographic diffusion, with some tags strongly linked to well identified geographic areas. Based on our findings, we demonstrate the potential of tags to help predict distribution of a video's views, and present results suggesting that tags canhelp place videos in globally distributed datacenters. We show in particular that even a simplistic approach based on tags can help predict a minimum of 65.9% of a video's views for a majority of videos, and that a simple tag-based placement strategy is able to improve the hit rate of a distributed on-line video service by up to 6.8% globally over a naive random allocation.",

            "Abstract": "Every physical machine in today's typical datacenter is backed by storage devices with hundreds of Gigabytes to Terabytes in size. Data center vendors usually use hard disk drives for their back-end storage as it is cheap and reliable. However, the increase in the I/O accesses to the back-end storage from one or many of the VMs hosted on a physical machine can reduce its overall accesses time significantly due to contention. This may not be suitable for interactive applications requiring low latency that might be co-located with other I/O intensive applications. In this paper we present Multi-Cache, a multi-layer cache management system that uses a combination of cache devices of varied speed and cost such as solid state drives, non-volatile memories, etc to mitigate this problem. Multi-Cache partitions each device dynamically at runtime according to the workload of each VM and its priority. We use a heuristic optimization technique that ensures maximum utilization of the caches resulting in a high hit rate. We use a weighted partitioning policy that improves latency by up to 72% for individual workloads, and a overall hit rate increase of up to 31% for host running several workloads together in comparison to standard LRU caching algorithms.",
            "TLDR": "This paper presents Multi-Cache, a multi-layer cache management system that uses a combination of cache devices of varied speed and cost such as solid state drives, non-volatile memories, etc to mitigate the problem of increase in I/O accesses from one or many of the VMs hosted on a physical machine."

            "Abstract": "With the availability of a wide range of cloud Virtual Machines (VMs) it is difficult to determine which VMs can maximise the performance of an application. Benchmarking is commonly used to this end for capturing the performance of VMs. Most cloud benchmarking techniques are typically heavyweight - time consuming processes which have to benchmark the entire VM in order to obtain accurate benchmark data. Such benchmarks cannot be used in real-time on the cloud and incur extra costs even before an application is deployed. In this paper, we present lightweight cloud benchmarking techniques that execute quickly and can be used in near real-time on the cloud. The exploration of lightweight benchmarking techniques are facilitated by the development of DocLite - Docker Container-based Lightweight Benchmarking. DocLite is built on the Docker container technology which allows a user-defined portion (such as memory size and the number of CPU cores) of the VM to be benchmarked. DocLite operates in two modes, in the first mode, containers are used to benchmark a small portion of the VM to generate performance ranks. In the second mode, historic benchmark data is used along with the first mode as a hybrid to generate VM ranks. The generated ranks are evaluated against three scientific high-performance computing applications. The proposed techniques are up to 91 times faster than a heavyweight technique which benchmarks the entire VM. It is observed that the first mode can generate ranks with over 90% and 86% accuracy for sequential and parallel execution of an application. The hybrid mode improves the correlation slightly but the first mode is sufficient for benchmarking cloud VMs.",

However, it is often difficult to use containers to manage the cloud infrastructure, without sacrificing many benefits container offers. This paper identifies the key challenges that impede realizing the full promise of containerizing infrastructure services. Using OpenStack as a case study, we explore solutions to these challenges. Specifically, we redesign OpenStack deployment architecture to enable dynamic service registration and discovery, explore different ways to manage service state in containers, and enable containers to access the host kernel and devices. We quantify the efficiency of the container-based microservice-style DevOps compared to the VM-based approach, and study the scalability of the stateless and stateful containerized components. We also discuss limitations in our current design, and highlight open research problems that, if solved, can lead to wider adoption of containers in cloud infrastructure management.",

            "Abstract": "According to a recent study, 30% of VMs in private cloud data centers are \"comatose\", in part because there is generally no strong incentive for their human owners to delete them at an appropriate time. These inactive VMs are still scheduled and executed on physical cloud resources, taking valuable access away from productive VMs. In an extreme, cloud infrastructure may deny legitimate requests for new VMs because capacity limits have been hit. It is not sufficient for cloud infrastructure to identify such inactive VMs by monitoring resource utilization (e.g., CPU utilization) ‚Äì e.g., management processes (e.g. virus-scan, software update) on inactive VMs often consume high CPU and memory resources, and active VMs with lightweight jobs (e.g. text editing) show almost zero resource utilization. To properly detect and address such inactive VMs, we present iCSI: a cloud garbage VM collector to improve resource utilization and cost efficiency of enterprise data centers. iCSI includes three main components, a lightweight data collector, a VM identification model and a recommendation engine. The data collector periodically gathers primitive information from VMs. The identification model infers the purpose of a VM from the data collection and extracts the most relevant features associated with the purpose. The recommendation engine offers proper actions to end users i.e., suspending or resizing VMs. In this prototype phase, iCSI is deployed into multiple data centers in IBM and manages more than 750 production VMs. iCSI achieves 20% better accuracy (90%) in identifying active/inactive VMs compared with state-of-the-art methods. With recommendations to end users, our estimation results show that iCSI can improve internal cost efficiency with 23% and resource utilization more than 45%.",

            "Abstract": "The concept of a shadow process simplifies the design and implementation of virtualization services such as system call forwarding and device file-level device virtualization. A shadow process on the host mirrors a process in the guest at the level of the virtual and physical address space, terminating in the host physical addresses. Previous shadow process mechanisms have required changes to the guest and host kernels. We describe a shadow process technique that is implemented at user-level in both the guest and the host. In our technique, we refer to the host shadow process as a dark shadow as it arranges its own elements to avoid conflicting with the guest process's elements. We demonstrate the utility of dark shadows by using our implementation to create system call forwarding and device file-level device virtualization prototypes that are compact and simple.",
            "TLDR": "This work describes a shadow process technique that is implemented at user-level in both the guest and the host and refers to the host shadow process as a dark shadow as it arranges its own elements to avoid conflicting with the guest process's elements."

A common approach is to use multiple distributed controllers, each managing one static partition of the network. In this paper, we show that dynamic mapping can improve efficiency in managing traffic load variations. We then propose BalCon (Balanced Controller): an algorithmic solution designed to tackle and reduce the load imbalance among SDN controllers through proper SDN switch migrations. Simulations demonstrate that BalCon is lightweight from the computational point of view and reduces the load imbalance among SDN controllers (expressed as variance) by 40% by migrating only a small number of switches. We also built a realistic prototype of SDN controller, BalConController, based on the open-source SDN framework RYU.",

Correspondingly, laws and regulations have beenestablished to protect such data. For a cloud-based analyticsservice provider, it is of paramount importance to protect thesensitive information contained in customer data, while runninganalytics on it. While there exist a plethora of technologies tosafeguard data, regulatory rules are not always defined in cleartechnical terms, and different regulations may impose different(or sometimes conflicting) rules on the analytics platform. Therefore, it remains a challenge in developing a platform that cansupport various security and compliance-enabling mechanisms, in a agile fashion, to reduce maintenance effort as well asimproving scalability and performance. To address this challenge, we introduce the design and implementationof a cloud-based middleware platform that supportson-demand composition and configuration of security mechanismsto ease regulatory compliance enablement. We discussat length our experiences and lessons learned from using ourplatform to deploy secure analytics systems at IBM and highlightthe benefits of our approach by discussing the performanceimpact and trade-offs of different security mechanisms withrespect to regulatory compliance.",

            "Abstract": "Many computing sites, LANL being one of them, have a requirement for long-term retention of mostly cold data. Although the main function of this storage tier is capacity, it does also have a bandwidth requirement. For many years, tape was the best economic solution for this requirement. However, over time, data sets have grown larger more quickly than tape bandwidth has improved. We have now entered a regime in which disk is the more economically efficient medium for this storage tier. Also more and more, data dominates the computing world. There is a \"sea\" of data out there in many different formats such as file, object, and Key-value that needs to be efficiently managed and effectively used. In this paper, we introduce a new hybrid storage system named MarFS. MarFS is a Near-POSIX File System using scale-out commercial/cloud for data and many POSIX file systems for metadata services. MarFS is an approach to support a data lake for HPC that sits on industry based commodity storage hardware and is a software layer that provides a global namespace and near POSIX semantics. MarFS provides the capability to serve as an umbrella over a variety of underling storage layers. In this paper, we present the system architecture of the proposed MarFS near-POISX file system, we conduct early functional performance testing cases on MarFS's software components, and finally we address current deployment status and future development works of the MarFS.",
            "TLDR": "The system architecture of the proposed MarFS near-POISX file system is presented, early functional performance testing cases on MarFS's software components are conducted, and the current deployment status and future development works of the MarFS are addressed."

Today, software is predominantly discovered through querying package management tools, or using rules that check for file metadata or contents. These approaches are inadequate as not every software is installed through package managers, and agile development practices lead to frequent deployment of software. Other approaches to software discovery use machine learning methods requiring training phase, or require maintaining knowledge bases. Columbus uses the knowledge of the software packaging practices that evolved over time, and uses the information embedded in the file system impression created by a software package to discover it. Columbus is able to discover software in 92% of all official Docker images. Further, Columbus can be used in problem diagnosis and drift detection situations to compare two different systems, or to determine the evolution of a system overtime.",

The scheduling problem has been widely studied and is well understood when the resource requirements and the expected lifetime of services are known beforehand. In contrast, when workloads are not known in advance, effective scheduling of services, and more generally system containers, becomes much more complex. In this paper, we propose GENPACK, a framework for system containers scheduling in cloud data centers that leverages principles from generational garbage collection (GC). It combines runtime monitoring of system containers to learn their requirements and properties, and a scheduler that manages different generations of servers. The population of these generations may vary over time depending on the global load, hence they are subject to being shut down when idle to save energy. We implemented GENPACK and tested it in a dedicated data center, showing that it can be up to 23% more energy-efficient that SWARM's built-in scheduling policies on a real-world trace.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing conveys the image of a pool of unlimited virtual resources that can be quickly and easily provisioned to accommodate the user requirements. However, this flexibility may require to adjust physical resources at the infrastructure level to keep the pace of user requests. While elasticity can be considered as the de facto solution to support this issue, this elasticity can still be broken by budget requirements or physical limitations of a private cloud. In this paper, we therefore explore an alternative, yet complementary, solution to the problem of resource provisioning by adopting the principles of garbage collection in the context of cloud computing. In particular, our approach consists in detecting idle virtual machines to recycle their resources when the cloud infrastructure reaches its limits. We implement this approach, named CloudGC, as a new middleware service integrated within OpenStack and we demonstrate its capacity to stop the waste of cloud resources. CloudGC periodically recycles idle VM instances and automatically recovers them whenever needed. Thanks to CloudGC, cloud infrastructures can even switch between operational configurations depending on periods of activities.",
            "TLDR": "This paper implements an alternative, yet complementary, solution to the problem of resource provisioning by adopting the principles of garbage collection in the context of cloud computing, named CloudGC, as a new middleware service integrated within OpenStack and demonstrates its capacity to stop the waste of cloud resources."

            "Abstract": "Docker containers are becoming an attractive implementation choice for next-generation microservices-based applications. When provisioning such an application, container (microservice) instances need to be created from individual container images. Starting a container on a node, where images are locally available, is fast but it may not guarantee the quality of service due to insufficient resources. When a collection of nodes are available, one can select a node with sufficient resources. However, if the selected node does not have the required image, downloading the image from a different registry increases the provisioning time. Motivated by these observations, in this paper, we present CoMICon, a system for co-operative management of Docker images among a set of nodes. The key features of CoMICon are: (1) it enables a co-operative registry among a set of nodes, (2) it can store or delete images partially in the form of layers, (3) it facilitates the transfer of image layers between registries, and (4) it enables distributed pull of an image while starting a container. Using these features, we describe‚Äî(i) high availability management of images and (ii) provisioning management of distributed microservices based applications. We extensively evaluate the performance of CoMICon using 142 real, publicly available images from Docker hub. In contrast to state-of-the-art full image based approach, CoMICon can increase the number of highly available images up to 3x while reducing the application provisioning time by 28% on average.",

            "Abstract": "Traditional in-house, laboratory-based medical imaging studies use hierarchical data structures (e.g., NFS file stores) or databases (e.g., COINS, XNAT) for storage and retrieval. The resulting performance from these approaches is, however, impeded by standard network switches since they can saturate network bandwidth during transfer from storage to processing nodes for even moderate-sized studies. To that end, a cloud-based \"medical image processing-as-a-service\" offers promise in utilizing the ecosystem of Apache Hadoop, which is a flexible framework providing distributed, scalable, fault tolerant storage and parallel computational modules, and HBase, which is a NoSQL database built atop Hadoop's distributed file system. Despite this promise, HBase's load distribution strategy of region split and merge is detrimental to the hierarchical organization of imaging data (e.g., project, subject, session, scan, slice). This paper makes two contributions to address these concerns by describing key cloud engineering principles and technology enhancements we made to the Apache Hadoop ecosystem for medical imaging applications. First, we propose a row-key design for HBase, which is a necessary step that is driven by the hierarchical organization of imaging data. Second, we propose a novel data allocation policy within HBase to strongly enforce collocation of hierarchically related imaging data. The proposed enhancements accelerate data processing by minimizing network usage and localizing processing to machines where the data already exist. Moreover, our approach is amenable to the traditional scan, subject, and project-level analysis procedures, and is compatible with standard command line/scriptable image processing software. Experimental results for an illustrative sample of imaging data reveals that our new HBase policy results in a three-fold time improvement in conversion of classic DICOM to NiFTI file formats when compared with the default HBase region split policy, and nearly a six-fold improvement over a commonly available network file system (NFS) approach even for relatively small file sets. Moreover, file access latency is lower than network attached storage.",
            "TLDR": "A row-key design for HBase is proposed and a novel data allocation policy within HBase to strongly enforce collocation of hierarchically related imaging data is proposed to accelerate data processing by minimizing network usage and localizing processing to machines where the data already exist."

            "Abstract": "Academic and industry experts are now advocating for going from large-centralized Cloud Computing infrastructures to smaller ones massively distributed at the edge of the network. Among the obstacles to the adoption of this model is the development of a convenient and powerful IaaS system capable of managing a significant number of remote data-centers in a unified way. In this paper, we introduce the premises of such a system by revising the OpenStack software, a leading IaaS manager in the industry. The novelty of our solution is to operate such an Internet-scale IaaS platform in a fully decentralized manner, using P2P mechanisms to achieve high flexibility and avoid single points of failure. More precisely, we describe how we revised the OpenStack Nova service by leveraging a distributed key/value store instead of the centralized SQL backend. We present experiments that validate the correct behavior and gives performance trends of our prototype through an emulation of several data-centers using Grid'5000 testbed. In addition to paving the way to the first large-scale and Internet-wide IaaS manager, we expect this work will attract a community of specialists from both distributed system and network areas to address the Fog/Edge Computing challenges within the OpenStack ecosystem.",

            "Abstract": "Real-time processing of big data has become a core operation in various areas of business, such as extracting value from real-time social network data. Big data workloads in the wild show a strong temporal variability that not only poses the risk of slow responsiveness in data analysis, but also leads to a high risk of service outage. The recent development of batch streaming systems based on the MapReduce framework is shown effective on non-overloaded systems. However, little is known on how to enhance the performance of the batch streaming systems for bursty workloads. In this paper, we propose a latency-driven data controller, Dslash, which aims to process as much data as possible, while processing these as fast as the application target latency and system capacity allow. In particular, we implement Dslash on Spark Streaming ‚Äì an emerging and complex batch streaming system. Dslash features include (i) placing data in an augmented distributed memory, (ii) shedding out-of-date data, (iii) improving the processing locality of Map tasks, and (iv) delaying data processing in transient overloads. Extensive evaluations on a large number of workloads show that Dslash can ensure stable and fast responsiveness compared to vanilla Spark Streaming systems.",

Hosting scientific modeling services using IaaS clouds requires awareness of application resource requirements and careful management of cloud-based infrastructure. In this paper, we present multiple methods to improve public cloud infrastructure management to support hosting scientific model services. We investigate public cloud VM-host heterogeneity and noisy neighbor detection to inform VM trial-and-better selection to favor worker VMs with better placements in public clouds. We present a cpuSteal noisy neighbor detection method (NN-Detect) which harnesses the cpuSteal CPU metric to identify worker VMs with resource contention from noisy neighbors. We evaluate potential performance improvements provided from leveraging these techniques in support of providing modeling-as-a-service for two environmental science models.",

But it also raises concern ondata privacy. To overcome the privacy issue, data is stored in anencrypted format. However encryption makes search over theprotected data convoluted. The need of the hour is to provide anefficient method for data storage and search over protected dataat remote provider without compromising with security. Inkeyword based search, each data item is associated with a set ofkeywords over which the search is performed. For a search, usersupplies keywords to the owner to get a corresponding trapdoor tobe searched over the provider. But the trapdoor is vulnerable toonline/ offline keyword guessing attack. This paper proposes onetime trapdoor scheme, where new trapdoors are generated everytime for searching keywords, eliminates the risk of online andoffline keyword guessing attack. The data encryption andtrapdoor generation is based on the non-polynomial hard problemof bilinear pairing and discrete logarithm. We have consideredhealth care data stored in hierarchical structure as a case studybut the scheme holds good for other pattern of storage as well.",

            "Abstract": "Enterprises today increasingly rely on IT for their day-to-day processes. Newer application types (such as web, mobile, social, and big data applications) and the advent of public cloud computing have further increased the role of IT in enterprises. The result is that a typical enterprise data center today can have thousands of workloads spanning tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of virtual machines. This makes day-to-day IT management tasks challenging for enterprise IT administrators, since they need to manage multiple types of hardware and software entities that can interact with each other in complex ways, and can span private data centers and public clouds. The problem is made worse by the management interfaces of current data center solutions, which work poorly at such a large scale, as they are navigational in nature and require administrators to learn a variety of tools and their myriad workflows. This can result in administrators spending too much time learning the tools and understanding when to use which tool, otherwise, they run the risk of making costly mistakes. In this paper we present the design and implementation of QUEST, a search-driven data center management system that provides an easy-to-use interface to search for data center entities, get information about them, and perform actions on them, all from a single pane of glass. QUEST allows administrators to express their intent through a semi-structured query language, and interfaces with multiple management components behind the scenes to return the most relevant information, this eliminates the need for administrators having to learn and remember the workflows of multiple data center management interfaces. We built QUEST [1] as a part of the Nutanix data center management solution [2] and it is currently used by 25% of Nutanix's customers [3] to manage tens of thousands of nodes. Initial customer feedback is positive and validates our hypothesis that search-based management interfaces are superior to traditional navigational interfaces in reducing administrator burden and making them more effective. Our evaluation shows that QUEST can support interactive use in real data centers, and a case study with a real customer performance trouble ticket shows that QUEST can reduce the number of steps by 6√ó compared to state-of-the-art management tools in troubleshooting scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing is a technology of inter-connected servers and resources that use virtualization to utilize the resources, flexibility, and scalability. Cloud computing is accessible through the network. This accessibility and utilization have its own benefit and drawbacks. Utilization and scalability make this technology more economic and affordable for small businesses. Flexibility drastically reduces the risk of starting businesses. Accessibility allows cloud customers not to be restricted in a specific location until they could have access to the network, and in most cases through the internet. These significant traits, however, have their own disadvantages. Easy accessibility makes it more convenient for the malicious user to have access to servers in the cloud. Virtualizations that come to existence by middleware software called Virtual Machine Managers (VMMs) or hypervisors come with different vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities are adding to previously existed vulnerability of Networks and Operating systems and Applications. In this research we are trying to distinguish the most resistant Hypervisor between (Xen, KVM and Virtual Box) against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, an attempt to saturate victims resources making them unavailable to legitimate users, or shutting down the services by using more than one machine as attackers by targeting three different resources (Network, CPU, Memory). This research will show how hypervisors act differently under the same attacks and conditions.",

            "Abstract": "Numerous event-based probing methods exist for cloud computing environments allowing a hypervisor to gain insight into guest activities. Such event-based probing has been shown to be useful for detecting attacks, system hangs through watchdogs, and for inserting exploit detectors before a system can be patched, among others. Here, we illustrate how to use such probing for trustworthy logging and highlight some of the challenges that existing event-based probing mechanisms do not address. Challenges include ensuring a probe inserted at given address is trustworthy despite the lack of attestation available for probes that have been inserted dynamically. We show how probes can be inserted to ensure proper logging of every invocation of a probed instruction. When combined with attested boot of the hypervisor and guest machines, we can ensure the output stream of monitored events is trustworthy. Using these techniques we build a trustworthy log of certain guest-system-call events. The log powers a cloud-tuned Intrusion Detection System (IDS). New event types are identified that must be added to existing probing systems to ensure attempts to circumvent probes within the guest appear in the log. We highlight the overhead penalties paid by guests to increase guarantees of log completeness when faced with attacks on the guest kernel. Promising results (less that 10% for guests) are shown when a guest relaxes the trade-off between log completeness and overhead. Our demonstrative IDS detects common attack scenarios with simple policies built using our guest behavior recording system.",

            "Abstract": "A recent direction in cloud computing is toward massive consolidation of resources by using lightweight virtual machines (VMs) called unikernels. Unikernels are specialized VMs that eliminate the operating system layer and provide a small footprint, minimal attack surface, and near-instant boot times. However, managing the privileges of thousands of unikernels hosted in Xen hypervisor and authoring complex Mandatory Access Control (MAC) policies using Xen Security Module (XSM)-Flask or sHype is often difficult and error prone for cloud administrators. XSM-Flask and sHype access control mechanisms have not reached wide adoption since their configuration and policies are complex and contain hundreds of subjects and objects for a single VM. Thus, we require an access control mechanism that is flexible, simple, integrated with unikernels and is efficient in order to regulate access to a large number of unikernels. In this paper, we present VirtusCap: a novel multi-layer access control architecture and mechanism that integrates capabilities with unikernels. Our approach employs capabilities to limit privileges of unikernels. Hence, our approach embodies the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) to create unikernels that have only the privileges they need to accomplish their task. Performance evaluations show that up to request rate of 7000 (req/sec) our prototype's response time is identical to XSM-Flask.",
            "TLDR": "VirtusCap is a novel multi-layer access control architecture and mechanism that integrates capabilities with unikernels that embodies the Principle of Least Privilege (POLP) to create unik kernels that have only the privileges they need to accomplish their task."

            "Abstract": "Timeouts are commonly used to handle unexpected failures in distributed systems. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study to characterize real-world timeout problems in 11 commonly used cloud server systems (e.g., Hadoop, HDSF, Spark, Cassandra, etc.). Our study reveals timeout problems are widespread among cloud server systems. We categorize those timeout problems in three aspects: 1) what are the root causes of those timeout problems? 2) what impact can timeout problems impose to cloud systems? 3) how are timeout problems currently diagnosed or misdiagnosed? Our results show that root causes of timeout problems include misused timeout, missing timeout, improper timeout handling, unnecessary timeout, and clock drifting. We further find timeout bugs impose serious impact (e.g., system hang or crash, job failure, performance degradation, data loss) to both applications and systems. Our study also shows that 60% of the bugs do not produce any error messages and 12% bugs produce misleading error messages, which makes it difficult to diagnose those timeout bugs.",

            "Abstract": "Active Virtual Machine (VM) replication is an application independent and cost-efficient mechanism for high availability and fault tolerance, with several recently proposed implementations based on checkpointing. However, these methods may suffer from large impacts on application latency, excessive resource usage overheads, and/or unpredictable behavior for varying workloads. To address these problems, we propose a hybrid approach through a Proportional-Integral (PI) controller to dynamically switch between periodic and on-demand check-pointing. Our mechanism automatically selects the method that minimizes application downtime by adapting itself to changes in workload characteristics. The implementation is based on modifications to QEMU, LibVirt, and OpenStack, to seamlessly provide fault tolerant VM provisioning and to enable the controller to dynamically select the best checkpointing mode. Our evaluation is based on experiments with a video streaming application, an e-commerce benchmark, and a software development tool. The experiments demonstrate that our adaptive hybrid approach improves both application availability and resource usage compared to static selection of a checkpointing method, with application performance gains and neglectable overheads.",

            "Abstract": "Intel's novel Software Guard eXtensions (SGX) enable secure and trusted execution of services, thereby paving the way to outsource sensitive data processing to external data centers. While SGX promises trusted execution close to native speed, frequent I/O operations and memory usage beyond a hardware-dependent threshold of currently 92 MiB result in substantial performance degradation. For memory-intensive workloads such as key-value stores and databases these penalties can be prohibitively high. We present STANlite ‚Äì an in-memory database engine for SGX-enabled secure data processing in rack-scale environments. STANlite performs efficient user-level paging, whenever a database workload requires more space than the performance-friendly in-memory state size. Furthermore, STANlite smartly combines the properties of Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) and SGX to reduce the overhead of network-based I/O operations. While SGX usually provides confidentiality and integrity at the same time, STANlite enables a purely integrity preserving data management mode for additional performance. Finally, STANlite features a small trusted computing base and is memory-efficient, as it extends SQLite, a database for embedded use. We evaluated STANlite in terms of query response time. It outperforms a vanilla SGX-based SQLite version by 1.79x for microbenchmarks and 2.44x for TPC-C.",

            "Abstract": "Software installation remains a challenge in scientific computing. End users require custom software stacks that are not provided through commodity channels. The resulting effort needed to install software delays research in the first place, and creates friction for moving applications to new resources and new users. Ideally, end-users should be able to manage their own software stacks without requiring administrator privileges. To that end, we describe vc3-builder, a tool for deploying software environments automatically on clusters. Its primary application comes in cloud and opportunistic computing, where deployment must be performed in batch as a side effect of job execution. vc3-builder uses workflow technologies as a means of exploiting cluster resources for building in a portable way. We demonstrate the use of vc3-builder on three applications with complex dependencies: MAKER, Octave, and CVMFS, building and running on three different cluster facilities in sequential, parallel, and distributed modes.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless computing is a new cloud programming and deployment paradigm that is receiving wide-spread uptake. Serverless offerings such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) Lambda, Google Functions, and Azure Functions automatically execute simple functions uploaded by developers, in response to cloud-based event triggers. The serverless abstraction greatly simplifies integration of concurrency and parallelism into cloud applications, and enables deployment of scalable distributed systems and services at very low cost. Although a significant first step, the serverless abstraction requires tools that software engineers can use to reason about, debug, and optimize their increasingly complex, asynchronous applications. Toward this end, we investigate the design and implementation of GammaRay, a cloud service that extracts causal dependencies across functions and through cloud services, without programmer intervention. We implement GammaRay for AWS Lambda and evaluate the overheads that it introduces for serverless micro-benchmarks and applications written in Python.",

            "Abstract": "Existing bare-metal cloud services that provide users with physical servers have a number of serious disadvantages over their virtual alternatives, including slow provisioning times, difficulty for users to release servers (physical machines) and then reuse them to handle changes in demand, and poor tolerance to failures. We introduce M2, a bare-metal cloud service that uses network-mounted boot drives to overcome these disadvantages. We describe the architecture and implementation of M2 and compare its agility, scalability and performance to existing systems. We show that M2 can reduce provisioning time by over 50% while offering richer functionality, and comparable run time performance with respect to tools that provision images into local disks. M2 is open source and available at https://github.com/CCI-MOC/ims.",

            "Abstract": "IaaS providers offer virtual machines of fix granularity which has prompted the evolution of derivative clouds. With a derivative setup where containers are provisioned within virtual machines, the guest OS manages virtual resources inside a VM whereas the hypervisor manages the physical resources distributed among VMs. This results in two control centers over the set of resources used by the containers. The hypervisor takes control actions such as memory ballooning or the withdrawal of a virtual CPU to manage over-provisioning without being aware of the effect these actions will have on individual containers inside the VM. The derivative cloud provider executing containers in the VM needs a mechanism to react to such changes‚Äîbased on resource management policies setup for this purpose. In this work we first show via experimental results that hypervisor actions used to manage over-commitment such as ballooning and vCPU stealing have unpredictable and non-deterministic effects on nested containers. Based on this analysis, we design a policy driven controller that smoothes over the effect of these hypervisor actions on these nested containers. We expose several useful policies for each resource type (CPU and Memory) that can help derivative cloud providers better manage container instances.",

            "Abstract": "Virtualized systems (e.g., public and private clouds) are playing an increasingly vital role to support the computing of applications from different domains. Existing resource management solutions in such systems typically treat virtual machines (VMs) as black boxes, which presents a hurdle to achieving application-desired Quality of Service (QoS). This paper advocates the cooperation between VM host- and guest-layer schedulers for optimizing the resource management and application performance. It presents an approach to such cross-layer optimization by enabling the host-layer scheduler to feedback resource allocation decisions and adapt guest-layer application configurations. As case studies, the proposed approach is applied to virtualized databases and map services which have challenging dynamic and complex resource demands as well as sophisticated configurations. Specifically, for databases, the proposed approach adapts query executions by tuning the cost model parameters according to the available storage bandwidth and memory capacity. For map services, it adapts the quality of returned map imagery in order to meet the response time target as the workload intensity and available network bandwidth change over time. A prototype of the proposed approach is implemented on Xen and Hyper-V VMs, and evaluated using a TPC-H based database workload and a TerraFly-based map service workload. The results show that with the proposed host-to-guest application adaptation, the TPC-H workload improves its performance by 33.5%, and the TerraFly workload improves the map imagery quality by 40% and always meets its response time target, compared to the schemes without adaptation.",
            "TLDR": "This paper presents an approach to such cross-layer optimization by enabling the host-layer scheduler to feedback resource allocation decisions and adapt guest-layer application configurations and shows that with the proposed host-to-guest application adaptation, the TPC-H workload improves its performance, and the TerraFly workload improves the map imagery quality and always meets its response time target."

OPTiC proposes opportunistic scheduling, whereby queued jobs can be pre-scheduled at cluster nodes when the cluster is fully busy running jobs. This allows overlapping of data ingress with ongoing computation. To pre-schedule wisely, OPTiC's novel contribution is a profile-free and cluster-agnostic approach to compare progress of graph processing jobs. OPTiC is implemented inside Apache Giraph, with YARN underneath. Our experiments with real workload traces and network models show that OPTiC's opportunistic scheduling improves run time (both at the median and at the tail) by 20%-82% compared to baseline multi-tenancy, in a variety of scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Many applications like geo-replication need to deliver multiple copies of data from a single datacenter to multiple datacenters, which has benefits of improving fault tolerance, increasing availability and achieving high service quality. These applications usually require completing multicast transfers before certain deadlines. Some of the existing works only consider unicast transfers, which is not appropriate for the multicast transmission type. An alternative approach proposed by existing works was to find a minimum weight Steiner tree for each transfer. Instead of using only one tree for each transfer, we propose to use one or multiple trees, which increases the flexibility of routing, improves the utilization of available bandwidth, and increases the throughput for each transfer. In this paper, we focus on the multicast transmission type, propose an efficient and effective solution that maximizes throughput for all transfer requests while meeting deadlines. We also show that our solution can reduce packet reordering by selecting very few Steiner trees for each transfer. We have implemented our solution on a software-defined overlay network at the application layer, and our real-world experiments on the Google Cloud Platform have shown that our system effectively improves the network throughput performance and has a lower traffic rejection rate compared to existing related works.",

            "Abstract": "The advent of the Cloud computing era along with the wide adoption of the distributed paradigm has enabled applications to increase their performance standards and greatly extend their scalability limits. Nevertheless, the ability of modern applications to be deployed in numerous different ways has complicated their structure and enormously increased the difficulty of extracting accurate performance models for them. This capability is crucial for many operations, such as the identification of the most appropriate execution setups for an anticipated workload, finding bottlenecks, etc. In this work, we propose a fully automated performance modeling methodology that aims at the creation of highly accurate performance models for a given maximum number of deployments. The main idea of the proposed methodology lies on the \"smart\" exploration of the application configuration space, the selection and deployment of a set of representative application configurations and the construction of the performance model through the adoption of Machine Learning techniques. Moreover, taking into consideration the often unstable and error-prone nature of the cloud, the proposed system attempts to overcome transient cloud failures that occur during the application deployment phase through the re-execution of the parts that failed. Our evaluation, conducted for a set of real-world applications frequently deployed over cloud infrastructures, indicates that our system is capable of both constructing performance models of high accuracy and doing so in an efficient manner, fixing application deployments that present errors without requiring human intervention.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless computing platforms provide function(s)-as-a-Service (FaaS) to end users while promising reduced hosting costs, high availability, fault tolerance, and dynamic elasticity for hosting individual functions known as microservices. Serverless Computing environments, unlike Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) cloud platforms, abstract infrastructure management including creation of virtual machines (VMs), operating system containers, and request load balancing from users. To conserve cloud server capacity and energy, cloud providers allow hosting infrastructure to go COLD, deprovisioning containers when service demand is low freeing infrastructure to be harnessed by others. In this paper, we present results from our comprehensive investigation into the factors which influence microservice performance afforded by serverless computing. We examine hosting implications related to infrastructure elasticity, load balancing, provisioning variation, infrastructure retention, and memory reservation size. We identify four states of serverless infrastructure including: provider cold, VM cold, container cold, and warm and demonstrate how microservice performance varies up to 15x based on these states.",

Meanwhile, cloud technology is undergoing a transition from conventional full-fledged virtual machines towards lightweight container-based solutions. This results in a heavy reduction of the virtualization overhead allowing to multiply the number of running instances. There is a need for highly scalable and efficient cloud infrastructures. Our study focuses on OpenStack, as an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider, and in particular the case of large service deployments on a single node. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the different network building blocks used by OpenStack. This reveals important scalability limitations which negatively impact the network performance of the node and cause an unreasonably high CPU usage. We identify some of the root causes for these scaling constraints and propose a number of alternative designs. Throughout both analytical and empirical methodologies, we demonstrate the benefits of our solutions in several aspects such as scalability, efficiency and performance.",

            "Abstract": "Operators of pipeline infrastructure buried underground are in many countries required to ensure that depth of cover‚Äîa measure of the quantity of soil covering a pipeline‚Äîlie within prescribed bounds. Traditionally, monitoring depth of cover at scale has been carried out qualitatively by means of visual inspection. We proceed instead to rely on airborne remote sensing techniques to obtain densely sampled ground surface point measurements from the pipeline's right of way, from which we determine depth of cover using automated algorithms. Proceeding in our manner presents a reproducible, quantitative approach to monitoring depth of cover, yet the demands thus made by the scale of real-world pipeline monitoring scenarios on compute and storage resources can be substantial. We show that the scalability afforded by the cloud can be leveraged to address such scenarios, distributing the algorithms we employ to take advantage of multiple compute nodes and exploiting elastic storage. While the use case underlying this paper is monitoring depth of cover, our proposed architecture can be applied more broadly to a wide variety of geospatial analytics tasks carried out 'in the large', including change detection, semantic classification or segmentation, or computation of vegetation indices.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing offers the potential to store, manage, and process data in highly available, scalable, and elastic environments. Yet, these environments still provide very limited and inflexible means for customers to control their data. For example, customers can neither specify security of inter-cloud communication bearing the risk of information leakage, nor comply with laws requiring data to be kept in the originating jurisdiction, nor control sharing of data with third parties on a fine-granular basis. This lack of control can hinder cloud adoption for data that falls under regulations. In this paper, we show in six use cases how cloud environments can be enriched with policy language support to give customers control over cloud data. Our use cases are based on realizing policy language support in all three cloud environment layers, i.e., IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. Specifically, we present policy-aware resource management (with OpenStack) and dynamic network configuration. With CERN's big data storage and the in-memory database Hyrise, we show realization for storage and further exemplify policy-aware cloud processing by network function virtualization which enables Orange to offload customer home gateways to the cloud. Finally, we discuss benefits of policy support in F-Secure's Security Cloud. These use cases show the feasibility of realizing customer control with policy support in the cloud. Thus, our work enables customers with regulated data to tap cloud benefits and significantly broadens the market for cloud providers.",

            "Abstract": "As use of cryptography increases in all areas of computing, efficient solutions for key management in distributed systems are needed. Large deployments in the cloud can require millions of keys for thousands of clients. The current approaches for serving keys are centralized components, which do not scale as desired. This work reports on the realization of a key manager that uses an untrusted distributed key-value store (KVS) and offers consistent key distribution over the Key-Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP). To achieve confidentiality, it uses a key hierarchy where every key except a root key itself is encrypted by the respective parent key. The hierarchy also allows for key rotation and, ultimately, for secure deletion of data. The design permits key rotation to proceed concurrently with key-serving operations. A prototype was integrated with IBM Spectrum Scale, a highly scalable cluster file system, where it serves keys for file encryption. Linear scalability was achieved even under load from concurrent key updates. The implementation shows that the approach is viable, works as intended, and suitable for high-throughput key serving in cloud platforms.",

            "Abstract": "With consumers embracing the prevalence of ubiquitously connected smart devices, Edge Computing is emerging as a principal computing paradigm for latency-sensitive and in-proximity services. However, as the plethora of data generated across connected devices continues to vastly increase, the need to query the \"edge\" and derive in-time analytic insights is more evident than ever. This paper introduces our vision for a rich and declarative query model abstraction particularly tailored for the unique characteristics of Edge Computing and presents a prototype framework that realizes our vision. Towards this, the declarative query model enables users to express high-level and descriptive analytic insights, while our framework compiles, optimizes and executes the query plan decoupled from the programming model of the underlying data processing engine. Afterwards, we showcase a number of potential use-cases which stand to benefit from the realization of query-driven descriptive analytics for edge computing. We conclude by elaborating on the open challenges that still must be addressed to realize our vision and potential research opportunities for the academic community to further advance the current State-of-the-Art.",

            "Abstract": "With the rapid growth of large online social networks, the ability to analyze large-scale social structure and behavior has become critically important, and this has led to the development of several scalable graph processing systems. In reality, however, social interaction takes place not only between pairs of individuals as in the graph model, but rather in the context of multi-user groups. Research has shown that such group dynamics can be better modeled through a more general hypergraph model, resulting in the need to build scalable hypergraph processing systems. In this paper, we present MESH, a flexible distributed framework for scalable hypergraph processing. MESH provides an easy-to-use and expressive application programming interface that naturally extends the \"think like a vertex\" model common to many popular graph processing systems. Our framework provides a flexible implementation based on an underlying graph processing system, and enables different design choices for the key implementation issues of partitioning a hypergraph representation. We implement MESH on top of the popular GraphX graph processing framework in Apache Spark. Using a variety of real datasets and experiments conducted on a local 8-node cluster as well as a 65-node Amazon AWS testbed, we demonstrate that MESH provides flexibility based on data and application characteristics, as well as scalability with cluster size. We further show that it is competitive in performance to HyperX, another hypergraph processing system based on Spark, while providing a much simpler implementation (requiring about 5X fewer lines of code), thus showing that simplicity and flexibility need not come at the cost of performance.",

            "Abstract": "Pre-trained deep learning models are increasingly being used to offer a variety of compute-intensive predictive analytics services such as fitness tracking, speech, and image recognition. The stateless and highly parallelizable nature of deep learning models makes them well-suited for serverless computing paradigm. However, making effective resource management decisions for these services is a hard problem due to the dynamic workloads and diverse set of available resource configurations that have different deployment and management costs. To address these challenges, we present a distributed and scalable deep-learning prediction serving system called Barista and make the following contributions. First, we present a fast and effective methodology for forecasting workloads by identifying various trends. Second, we formulate an optimization problem to minimize the total cost incurred while ensuring bounded prediction latency with reasonable accuracy. Third, we propose an efficient heuristic to identify suitable compute resource configurations. Fourth, we propose an intelligent agent to allocate and manage the compute resources by horizontal and vertical scaling to maintain the required prediction latency. Finally, using representative real-world workloads for an urban transportation service, we demonstrate and validate the capabilities of Barista.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud storage services are often associated with various performance issues due to load imbalance, interference from background tasks such as data scrubbing, backfilling, recovery, and the difference in processing capabilities of heterogeneous servers in a datacenter. This has a significant impact on a broad range of applications that are characterized by massive working sets and real-time constraints. However, it is challenging and burdensome for human operators to hand-tune various control-knobs in a cloud-scale storage cluster for maintaining optimal performance under diverse workload conditions. Our study on an open-source object-based storage system, Ceph, shows that common load balancing strategies are ineffective unless they are adapted according to workload characteristics. Furthermore, positive effects of an applied strategy may not be immediately visible. To address these challenges, we developed a machine learning based system adaptation technique that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks. In particular, we applied a stochastic policy gradient based reinforcement learning technique to track performance hotspots in the storage cluster, and take appropriate corrective actions to maximize future performance under a variety of complex scenarios. For this purpose, we leveraged system-level performance monitoring and commonly available control-knobs in object-based cloud storage systems. We implemented the developed techniques to build an Adaptive Resource Management (ARM) system for object based storage cluster, and evaluated its performance on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed. Experiments using Cloud Object Storage Benchmark (COSBench) show that, ARM improves the average read and write response time of Ceph storage cluster by upto 50% and 33% respectively, compared to the default case. It also outperforms a state-of-the-art dynamic load rebalancing technique in terms of read and write performance of Ceph storage by 43% and 36% respectively.",
            "TLDR": "A machine learning based system adaptation technique is developed that enables a cloud storage system to manage itself through load balancing and data migration with the aim of delivering optimal performance in the face of diverse workload patterns and resource bottlenecks."

            "Abstract": "Volatile resources are surplus cloud resources not consumed by high priority foreground (reserved/on-demand) load. These resources are exploited by a growing number of users. Today, cloud operators provide no statistical characterization of volatile resources. We consider how releasing such statistics could improve user value by studying Amazon's 608 EC2 Spot Instance types. Results show that as little as two parameters such as (average, 90pctile) can increase user value by 30%. These results are robust over four-fifths (475 of 608) of instance types. Beyond competitive concerns, cloud operators are reluctant to share volatile resource statistics because they might be considered a service-level agreement (SLA), and thus constrain their ability to serve foreground load. We show that clever resource management can allay such concerns. We study two plausible classes of foreground load changes, showing one class where such a concern is indeed valid and another where it is not. We design two online resource management algorithms that detect foreground load variation and adapt to maintain a statistical SLA. The algorithms not only improve the ability to maintain guarantees and user value but also improve user experience, reducing job failures by 50%. These results apply to the Stable and Transition classes of instance types, which account for nearly all of the instance types (577 of 608).",
            "TLDR": "Two online resource management algorithms are designed that detect foreground load variation and adapt to maintain a statistical SLA, and improve the ability to maintain guarantees and user value but also improve user experience."

            "Abstract": "The number and scale of data centers are both rapidly increasing due to a continuously growing demand for cloud computing services from many areas. Cloud computing infrastructure relies on a massive amount of HPC servers to process millions of tasks and consumes an enormous amount of power. The implementation of advanced task allocation technology provides a solution for energy efficiency and has therefore become an essential goal for data centers. In this paper, we propose a novel CPU-intensive workload allocation optimizer (WAO) for the task of power saving within data centers. There are three major contributions to this research. First, a data center monitoring module, which continually reports the latest status of the data center and stores operational data. Second, we propose an accurate and efficient server power prediction model for all servers in the HPC clusters. Third, we provide an optimal task assignment engine that evaluates and assigns tasks to the most appropriate server to facilitate minimal power consumption. Our experimental results show that our proposed WAO can obtain about 29.6% power savings and 26% more productivity in a real data center.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes a novel CPU-intensive workload allocation optimizer (WAO) for the task of power saving within data centers and provides an optimal task assignment engine that evaluates and assigns tasks to the most appropriate server to facilitate minimal power consumption."

The following aspects are investigated in this work: (i) mechanisms for dividing a workflow across edge and cloud/data centre resources; (ii) service hosting environments that can be shared across edge and data centre resources; (iii) performance metrics that can influence service placement and selection. An \"edge orchestrator\" is a resource manager that makes such decisions on the behalf of a user application, and which may be centralised or distributed. An industry scenarios is used to illustrate decision points that influence such choices within an edge orchestrator. The overall objective considered is the completion of the workflow within some deadline constraint by the edge orchestrator.",
            "TLDR": "This work investigates mechanisms for dividing a workflow across edge and cloud/data centre resources, and performance metrics that can influence service placement and selection within an edge orchestrator."

            "Abstract": "This paper introduces a novel service for distributed detection and summarization of crowd-sensed events. The work is motivated by the proliferation of microblogging media, such as Twitter, that can be used to detect and describe events in the physical world, such as protests, disasters, or civil unrest. Since crowd-sensed data is likely to be distributed, we consider an architecture, where the data first accumulates across a plurality of edge servers (e.g. cloudlets or repositories) and is then summarized, rather than being shipped directly to its ultimate destination (e.g., in a remote cloud). The architecture allows graceful handling of overload and bandwidth limitations (e.g., in scenarios where capacity is impaired, as the case might be after a disaster). When bandwidth is scarce, our service, BigEye, only transfers very limited metadata from the distributed edge repositories to the central summarizer and yet supports highly accurate detection and concise summarization of key events of global interest. These summaries can then be sent to consumers (e.g., rescue personnel). Our emulations show that BigEye achieves the same precision and recall values in detecting key events as a system where all data is available centrally, while consuming only 1% of the bandwidth needed to transmit all raw data.",
            "TLDR": "Emulations show that BigEye achieves the same precision and recall values in detecting key events as a system where all data is available centrally, while consuming only 1% of the bandwidth needed to transmit all raw data."

Initially electricity was generated locally but economies of scale (and standardization) made it more efficient and economical to have utility companies managing the electric grid. Similar developments can be seen in computing where scientific grids paved the way for commercial cloud computing offerings. However, in our opinion, that evolution is far from finished and in this paper we bring forward the remaining challenges and propose a vision for the future of computing. In particular we focus on diverging trends in the costs of computing and developer time, which suggests that future computing architectures will need to optimize for developer time.",

            "Abstract": "The efficient operation and resource management of multi-tenant data centers hosting thousands of services is a demanding task, that requires precise and detailed information regarding the behaviour of each and every virtual machine (VM). Often, coarse measures such as CPU, memory, disk and network usage by VMs are considered in grouping them onto the same physical server, as detailed measures would require access to the guest operating system (OS), which is not feasible in a multi-tenant setting. In this paper, we propose host-level hypervisor tracing as a non-intrusive means to extract useful features, that can provide for fine grain characterization of VM behaviour. In particular, we extract VM blocking periods as well as virtual interrupt injection rates to detect multiple levels of resource intensiveness. In addition, we consider the resource contention rate due to other VMs and the host, along with reasons for exit from non-root to root privileged mode, revealing useful information about the nature of the underlying VM workload. We also use tracing to get information about the rate of process and thread preemption in each VM, extracting process and thread contention as another feature set. We then employ various feature selection strategies and assess the quality of the resulting workload clustering. Notably, we adopt a two-stage feature selection approach in addition to a one shot clustering scheme. Moreover, we consider inter-cluster and intra-cluster similarity metrics, such as the silhouette score, to discover distinct groups of workloads as well as workload groups with significant overlap. This information can be used by 1) data center administrators to gain deeper visibility into the nature of various VMs running on their infrastructure, 2) performance engineers to assist root cause analysis of VM issues and 3) IaaS providers to help in resource management based on VM behavior.",

            "Abstract": "Containers have become increasingly popular for deploying applications in cloud computing infrastructures. However, recent studies have shown that containers are prone to various security attacks. In this paper, we conduct a study on the effectiveness of various vulnerability detection schemes for containers. Specifically, we implement and evaluate a set of static and dynamic vulnerability attack detection schemes using 28 real world vulnerability exploits that widely exist in docker images. Our results show that the static vulnerability scanning scheme only detects 3 out of 28 tested vulnerabilities and dynamic anomaly detection schemes detect 22 vulnerability exploits. Combining static and dynamic schemes can further improve the detection rate to 86% (i.e., 24 out of 28 exploits). We also observe that the dynamic anomaly detection scheme can achieve more than 20 seconds lead time (i.e., a time window before attacks succeed) for a group of commonly seen attacks in containers that try to gain a shell and execute arbitrary code.",
            "TLDR": "This paper implements and evaluates a set of static and dynamic vulnerability attack detection schemes using 28 real world vulnerability exploits that widely exist in docker images and shows that the static vulnerability scanning scheme only detects 3 out of 28 tested vulnerabilities and dynamic anomaly detection schemes detect 22 vulnerability exploits."

            "Abstract": "The correct implementation of network policies for \"in-production\" network functions is critical, as it determines the security, availability and performance of a production network. Usually, conducting network testing for these network functions in a live production environment is attractive, as the production environment captures the most exact, realistic dynamic state and vulnerabilities of the system under test. However, doing so also brings potential risks of impacting or even damaging the production system. To address this tension, we present ShadeNF, a novel online platform for testing in-cloud network functions in a production-like environment, without disrupting the real production system. ShadeNF enables such a production-like environment with an exact live clone of production network functions and real production traffic as the test traffic. In designing and implementing ShadeNF, we address several key challenges and contribute new techniques in supporting such a testing platform, including an SDN-based live, consistent snapshot approach, a new programmable forwarding plane, and a scaled test traffic generator. We implement a ShadeNF prototype upon OpenStack and demonstrate that ShadeNF successfully captures the dynamics of production systems, and effectively localizes a range of policy violations in SDN/NFV systems.",

Even though each provider has a rich product offering, there are many scenarios where a multi-cloud strategy is desirable: utilizing economic dynamics, preventing data lock-in with one vendor, circumventing geographic restrictions, complying with local regulations, or combining on-premise and public-cloud resources. The challenge from a consumer perspective with multi-cloud deployments is the lack of a common abstraction for the offered products and a standardized way to express all of the application requirements for the resulting deployments. In this paper, we contribute by making yet another case for multi-cloud deployments and by predicting the emergence of a new generation of application-level resource managers which will natively support multi-cloud for enterprise applications. We identify three main components of the feedback loop controlled application-level resource managers: the software life-cycle manager, the data storage and access manager, and the service execution manager.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud platforms often execute parallel batch applications, such as distributed machine learning (ML), that include numerous synchronization barriers. These barriers, which prevent any task from advancing beyond a specified point until all tasks have reached that point, significantly degrade application performance by reducing it to that of the slowest \"straggler\" task. To address the problem, researchers have proposed numerous straggler mitigation techniques, including speculatively re-executing straggler tasks and various relaxations of strict barrier semantics. While these techniques improve parallel application performance, they incur a cost in terms of the resources wasted re-executing tasks or waiting. Importantly, these costs, which are often implicit in prior work that targets dedicated resources, become explicit in the cloud, which charges for resources at fine-grained intervals. In addition, the cost difference between techniques is exacerbated in cloud platforms, since they charge substantially less for transient resources that effectively yield a probabilistic performance across a wide range. While transient resources' low list price is attractive, revocations increase the frequency and severity of stragglers, which decreases parallel job performance and increases overall execution cost. To better understand the cost of synchronization, we develop simple analytical models of different straggler mitigation techniques and compare their cost and performance on on-demand and transient resources. Our analysis shows that i) transient servers offer complex tradeoffs compared to on-demand servers, and can result in higher overall costs despite their highly discounted price due to their probabilistic performance; ii) common approaches to straggler mitigation, which is a well-studied problem, are less effective using transient servers that cause frequent and severe stragglers; and iii) a recent approach to flexible synchronization offers the best cost and performance.",
            "TLDR": "To better understand the cost of synchronization, simple analytical models of different straggler mitigation techniques are developed and their cost and performance on on-demand and transient resources are compared."

            "Abstract": "At the core of the value proposition of edge computing is the ability to put computation close enough to the data sources, on demand. However, the data sources, computational infrastructure and software services needed to come together to power emerging and future edge computing applications are fragmented across different stakeholders, each with their own incentives, policies, and constraints on resources they can afford. This fragmentation limits the ability of edge computing to guarantee to applications and data the edge which will deliver the desired benefit. In this paper, we present our vision for an Edge Exchange, a decentralized directory service for a multi-stakeholder edge, as a path forward to enabling applications to be deployed across the best available edge resources, while still providing each stakeholder with controls regarding their resource use and sharing policies.",

            "Abstract": "Configuration tuning of software is often a good option to improve application performance without any application code modifications. Although we can casually change configurations, it is not easy to apply optimal configurations, as optimal configurations require deep knowledge of the underlying system. This is problematic because applications with suboptimal configuration result in poor performance. As container and container management systems have emerged as an application platform on the cloud, configuration tuning becomes even more challenging because containers add more complexity to the application performance. We need to consider not only fundamental misconfiguration but also container image verification, deployment configuration, application characteristics awareness based on metrics and logs. Although previous knowledge regarding how we should tune configurations for a system software is sometimes available, knowledge about performance tuning practices is neither normalized nor reusable to expand on any advice for misconfiguration to the containers. Even in the cloud-native environment, there is no centralized service to deliver knowledge continuously to application containers nor a framework to develop a misconfiguration fix rule for a container throughout its lifetime. In this paper, we propose a performance-centric configuration tuning framework for containers on Kubernetes, named ConfAdvisor, that enables containers to achieve a higher performance by validating various misconfigurations adaptively. ConfAdivsor gives config tuning advice to application containers, images, and Kubernetes specs and also provides a development framework to build configuration validation rules. We present the design of ConfAdvisor and provide several case studies to tune application containers in the real world.",

Live migration associated with maintenance work is important to ensure service continuity for all virtual machines in an infrastructure. However, executing the migration process when the machines are under heavy load negatively affects cloud users' businesses, such as by degrading performance and extending downtime. We can avoid this by finding an appropriate time period for live migration and performing the migration then. This idea is convenient for cloud users but inconvenient for cloud providers, that is, maintenance work should be completed as soon as possible for security reasons. To satisfy both the users' convenience and providers' requirements, we designed a maintenance scheduling problem to find the appropriate time period and to shorten the maintenance work period. Since it is a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem with complex constraints on maintenance requirements, we described the constraints by using answer set programming and implemented a maintenance scheduler on the basis of a divide-and-conquer approach to reduce the computational complexity exponentially. We evaluated our scheduler by using information on a real configuration of a commercial cloud infrastructure. While a naive approach to solving the maintenance scheduling problem could not find any feasible solutions within a realistic amount of time and memory, our implementation generated the best maintenance schedule for 1032 physical machines and 14208 virtual machines in 206 s with a memory usage of 1086 MB.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud platforms are increasingly using containers for lightweight virtualization. Unlike full system virtual machines (VMs) that each runs its own operating system, containers share a stateful operating system to reduce their memory footprint and execution overheads. However, mainstream operating systems are currently limited in their ability to customize a container's memory management, since they lack the necessary abstractions and mechanisms to accurately track and isolate a container's memory footprint. We propose a new abstraction, called the Container-Level Address Space (CLAS), that provides a unified view of a container's memory across all of its constituent processes. We present the design of ContainerVisor, a per-container resource management system that leverages CLAS to provide customized memory management services. We describe a ContainerVisor prototype on Linux for running unmodified applications and demonstrate three proof-of-concept customized services, namely process-level memory limits and reservations, container-specific page replacement policies, and privacy-aware memory de-allocation. Our evaluations show that ContainerVisor can provide these customized services within reasonable overheads.",
            "TLDR": "The design of ContainerVisor is presented, a per-container resource management system that leverages CLAS to provide customized memory management services and three proof-of-concept customized services are demonstrated, namely process-level memory limits and reservations, container-specific page replacement policies, and privacy-aware memory de-allocation."

            "Abstract": "Large-scale web services are increasingly adopting cloud-native principles of application design to better utilize the advantages of cloud computing. This involves building an application using many loosely coupled service-specific components (microservices) that communicate via lightweight APIs, and utilizing containerization technologies to deploy, update, and scale these microservices quickly and independently. However, managing the end-to-end tail latency of requests flowing through the microservices is challenging in the absence of accurate performance models that can capture the complex interplay of microservice workflows with cloudinduced performance variability and inter-service performance dependencies. In this paper, we present performance characterization and modeling of containerized microservices in the cloud. Our modeling approach aims at enabling cloud platforms to combine resource usage metrics collected from multiple layers of the cloud environment, and apply machine learning techniques to predict the end-to-end tail latency of microservice workflows. We implemented and evaluated our modeling approach on NSF Cloud's Chameleon testbed using KVM for virtualization, Docker Engine for containerization and Kubernetes for container orchestration. Experimental results with an open-source microservices benchmark, Sock Shop, show that our modeling approach achieves high prediction accuracy even in the presence of multi-tenant performance interference.",

            "Abstract": "Services hosted in multi-tenant cloud platforms often encounter performance interference due to contention for non-partitionable resources, which in turn causes unpredictable behavior and degradation in application performance. To grapple with these problems and to define effective resource management solutions for their services, providers often must expend significant efforts and incur prohibitive costs in developing performance models of their services under a variety of interference scenarios on different hardware. This is a hard problem due to the wide range of possible co-located services and their workloads, and the growing heterogeneity in the runtime platforms including the use of fog and edge-based resources, not to mention the accidental complexities in performing application profiling under a variety of scenarios. To address these challenges, we present FECBench (Fog/Edge/Cloud Benchmarking), an open source framework comprising a set of 106 applications covering a wide range of application classes to guide providers in building performance interference prediction models for their services without incurring undue costs and efforts. Through the design of FECBench, we make the following contributions. First, we develop a technique to build resource stressors that can stress multiple system resources all at once in a controlled manner, which helps to gain insights into the impact of interference on an application's performance. Second, to overcome the need for exhaustive application profiling, FECBench intelligently uses the design of experiments (DoE) approach to enable users to build surrogate performance models of their services. Third, FECBench maintains an extensible knowledge base of application combinations that create resource stresses across the multi-dimensional resource design space. Empirical results using real-world scenarios to validate the efficacy of FECBench show that the predicted application performance has a median error of only 7.6% across all test cases, with 5.4% in the best case and 13.5% in the worst case.",

In November 2017, Amazon.com changed the pricing mechanism for its preemptible \"spot instances\" so that prices would change more \"smoothly.\" This paper analyzes the effect of this change on spot instance prices. It examines the prices immediately before and after the mechanism change to determine the extent to which prices themselves changed. It then compares the 90-day period immediately after the change in mechanism to the next 90-day period. Finally, it compares the two most recent 90-day periods (ending on October 15, 2018). Our results indicate that in addition to smoothing prices, the mechanism change introduced generally higher prices which is a trend that continues.",

            "Abstract": "Internet of Things (IoT) allows the creation of virtually endless connections into a global array of distributed intelligence. However, the design, development, and deployment of IoT applications are complex and complicated due to various unwarranted challenges. For instance, addressing the IoT application users‚Äô subjective and objective opinions with IoT workflow instances remains a challenge for the design of a more holistic approach. Moreover, the complexity of IoT applications increased exponentially due to the heterogeneous nature of the Edge/Cloud services, utilised with the aim of lowering latency in data transformation and increase re-usability. Hence, in this paper, we present an IoT workflow composition system (IoTWC) to allow IoT users to pipeline their workflows with proposed IoT workflow activity abstract patterns. IoTWC leverages the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) to compose the multi-level IoT workflow that satisfies the requirements of any IoT application. Moreover, the users are befitted with recommended IoT workflow configurations using an AHP based multi-level composition framework. The proposed IoTWC is validated on a user case study to evaluate the coverage of IoT workflow activity abstract patterns and a real-world scenario for smart buildings. The comprehensive analysis shows the effectiveness of IoTWC in terms of IoT workflow abstraction and composition.",

            "Abstract": "Internet of things (IoT) with a cloud server has become popular nowadays and it‚Äôs going to be used in almost every aspect of human life. All devices will be connected to the internet and can communicate with each other where cloud plays an import role in the IoT environment. However, often cloud-enabled IoT environments have potential security risks and do not have multi-user support. In this paper, we discuss an IoT push messaging framework named CloudPush framework consisting of a client application, IoT devices, and a cloud system. In this framework, IoT devices can work on an ad hoc network and send event notifications to the client applications through the cloud. We show that CloudPush framework has vulnerabilities while maintaining multiple user accounts between a client application and IoT device in the cloud. The client application can receive unintended and unauthorized notification messages due to the lack of managing multiple accounts properly in the cloud server. To ensure stability in this framework while sending push notifications through the cloud by IoT devices, we discuss potential vulnerabilities and their solutions in this paper. We demonstrate that the aggregated throughput of CloudPush framework is 12-15% better than IoTivity framework even though IoTivity does not support multi-user for an IoT resource and a client application. If IoT device‚Äôs events are sent to multiple client applications i.e. events are distributed among client applications, then the throughput of CloudPush framework increases to 12-25% compared with the IoTivity framework because the CloudPush framework runs optimized searching algorithm in cloud and scales event notifications in both cloud server and cloud push service layer. For a secured multi-user support, notification message data is encrypted that makes the CloudPush system 3-5% slower but still, it performs 9-12% better than the IoTivity framework.",
            "TLDR": "It is demonstrated that the aggregated throughput of CloudPush framework is 12-15% better than IoTivity framework even though IoTivity does not support multi-user for an IoT resource and a client application and if IoT device‚Äôs events are distributed among client applications, the throughput ofCloudPush framework increases to 12-25% compared with the IoTivity frameworks."

            "Abstract": "Smart applications, including Internet of Things (IoT) and Big Data analytics, are traditionally hosted by cloud infrastructures, which can result in high latency and cost beyond users expectation. Edge computing has emerged as a paradigm that can alleviate the pressure on clouds by delegating parts of the computation to devices in the edge of the network, at closer proximity to end users and IoT devices. In this paper, we discuss a smart application, built on top of mobile edge computing concept, to enables users to measure and analyse their food intake and support nutritional decision-making. The approach utilizes mobile edge computing to offload application computations and communications to the edge, thus saving battery life, increasing the processing capacity, and improving user comfort. In order to develop this system, we propose a loosely coupled architecture for a smart food scanner and then implement it using various IoT sensors. The performance evaluation results reveal that the implemented system can be used as an interactive appliance by users with minimum dependency and usage of their mobile phones.",

            "Abstract": "Deep Neural Networks are allowing mobile devices to incorporate a wide range of features into user applications. However, the computational complexity of these models makes it difficult to run them effectively on resource-constrained mobile devices. Prior work approached the problem of supporting deep learning in mobile applications by either decreasing model complexity or utilizing powerful cloud servers. These approaches each only focus on a single aspect of mobile inference and thus they often sacrifice overall performance.In this work we introduce a holistic approach to designing mobile deep inference frameworks. We first identify the key goals of accuracy and latency for mobile deep inference and the conditions that must be met to achieve them. We demonstrate our holistic approach through the design of a hypothetical framework called MDINFERENCE. This framework leverages two complementary techniques; a model selection algorithm that chooses from a set of cloud-based deep learning models to improve inference accuracy and an on-device request duplication mechanism to bound latency. Through empirically-driven simulations we show that MDINFERENCE improves aggregate accuracy over static approaches by over 40% without incurring SLA violations. Additionally, we show that with a target latency of 250ms, MDINFERENCE increased the aggregate accuracy in 99.74% cases on faster university networks and 96.84% cases on residential networks.",

            "Abstract": "With billions of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as sensors, security cameras, and dash cams, generating huge amounts of data and transferring it to the cloud, it creates a network bottleneck with the increase of latency and bandwidth usage. Edge computing (EC) as an emerging technology is able to lighten the burden by bringing computational processes to the network edge close to data sources. According to Cisco [1], 75% of generated data consuming network bandwidth is video data. Traditionally video data is handled in the cloud due to its requirements of large storage space and high computational capacity. Dash cams are becoming prevalent as more drivers include them in their vehicles for surveillance or future incident investigation purposes. They are one representative type of IoT device that constantly generates large amounts of data. With such small storage space, the loop mechanism is a common implementation which allows the device to ‚Äòoverride‚Äô older video files when it has reached maximum storage capacity. In this paper, we design EdgeSum as an edge-based video summarization framework that utilizes mobile devices in the form of edge servers to summarize/compress video data of dash cams before uploading to the cloud for further processing and archiving purposes. The results support the feasibility of the framework in real-world practical applications including vehicles in driving mode, vehicles in parked mode, and surveillance applications. Based on the results, the framework delivers satisfactory performance in reducing latency and bandwidth usage by compressing the video data through summarization technique.",

            "Abstract": "The low-latency requirements of connected electric vehicles and their increasing computing needs have led to the necessity to move computational nodes from the cloud data centers to edge nodes such as road-side units (RSU). However, offloading the workload of all the vehicles to RSUs may not scale well to an increasing number of vehicles and workloads. To solve this problem, computing nodes can be installed directly on the smart vehicles, so that each vehicle can execute the heavy workload locally, thus forming a vehicular edge computing system. On the other hand, these computational nodes may drain a considerable amount of energy in electric vehicles. It is therefore important to manage the resources of connected electric vehicles to minimize their energy consumption.In this paper, we propose an algorithm that manages the computing nodes of connected electric vehicles for minimized energy consumption. The algorithm achieves energy savings for connected electric vehicles by exploiting the discrete settings of computational power for various performance levels. We evaluate the proposed algorithm and show that it considerably reduces the vehicles‚Äô computational energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, our algorithm achieves 15-85% energy savings compared to a baseline that executes workload locally and an average of 51% energy savings compared to a baseline that offloads vehicles‚Äô workloads only to RSUs.",
            "TLDR": "The proposed algorithm achieves energy savings for connected electric vehicles by exploiting the discrete settings of computational power for various performance levels and reduces the vehicles‚Äô computational energy consumption compared to state-of-the-art baselines."

            "Abstract": "A cloud provider that can technically determine tenants‚Äô operations may be compelled to disclose such activities by law enforcement agencies (LEAs). The situation gets even more complex when multiple LEAs across different jurisdictions are involved, e.g., because of the distributed locations of cloud servers and data storage. Yet cloud providers typically do not need or want to know about their tenants‚Äô activities, other than measuring how such activities incur expenses for using cloud resources.Thus mechanisms should be developed for cloud providers to have sufficient plausible deniability with regards to the processing being carried out by tenants on their platform, in jurisdictions that permit cloud providers to avoid liabilities in this way. Symmetrically, such mechanisms could protect tenants from legal over-reach, for example, when the country in which the cloud provider is incorporated could force disclosure of the processing carried out by cloud tenants.But to what extent can cloud providers acquire plausible deniability? Current discussions regarding risk have focused on data confidentiality and integrity. We argue that processing operations can equally reveal sensitive information‚Äîsuch as trade secrets and business processes‚Äîand that for some classes of application both data protection and algorithm protection are necessary.In this paper, we examine the legal and technical motivations for achieving plausible deniability in cloud interactions. We demonstrate the likely performance overhead of using containers secured with technologies such as Intel SGX. Further, we examine the current limitations of our proposed plausible deniability mechanisms, and outline a potential approach for enabling lawful access to enclaves subject to appropriate judicial oversight.",
            "TLDR": "It is argued that processing operations can equally reveal sensitive information‚Äîsuch as trade secrets and business processes‚Äîand that for some classes of application both data protection and algorithm protection are necessary."

            "Abstract": "Deep learning models are increasingly used for end-user applications, supporting both novel features such as facial recognition, and traditional features, e.g. web search. To accommodate high inference throughput, it is common to host a single pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in dedicated cloud-based servers with hardware accelerators such as Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). However, GPUs can be orders of magnitude more expensive than traditional Central Processing Unit (CPU) servers. These resources could also be under-utilized facing dynamic workloads, which may result in inflated serving costs. One potential way to alleviate this problem is by allowing hosted models to share the underlying resources, which we refer to as multi-tenant inference serving. One of the key challenges is maximizing the resource efficiency for multi-tenant serving given hardware with diverse characteristics, models with unique response time Service Level Agreement (SLA), and dynamic inference workloads. In this paper, we present PERSEUS, a measurement framework that provides the basis for understanding the performance and cost trade-offs of multi-tenant model serving. We implemented PERSEUS in Python atop a popular cloud inference server called Nvidia TensorRT Inference Server. Leveraging PERSEUS, we evaluated the inference throughput and cost for serving various models and demonstrated that multi-tenant model serving led to up to 12% cost reduction.",

            "Abstract": "Accurate performance prediction for cloud applications is an essential component to support many cloud resource management and auto-scaling policies. However, most existing studies on performance prediction for cloud applications in multitenant clouds are at the system level and may require access to performance counters in hypervisors. In this work, we propose uPredict, a user-level profiler-based performance predictive framework for single-VM (virtual machine) applications in multitenant clouds. We designed three micro-benchmarks to assess the contention of CPUs, memory and disks in a VM, respectively. Based on the measured performance of an application and micro-benchmarks, the application and VM-specific predictive models are derived by exploiting various regression and neural network based techniques. These models can then be used to predict the application‚Äôs performance using the in-situ profiled resource contention with the micro-benchmarks. We evaluated uPredict extensively with representative benchmarks from PARSEC, NAS Parallel Benchmarks and CloudSuite, on a private cloud and two public clouds. The results show that the average prediction errors are between 10.4% to 17% for various predictive models on the private cloud with high resource contention, while the errors are within 4% on public clouds. A smart load-balancing scheme powered by uPredict is presented and can effectively reduce the execution and turnaround times of the considered application by 19% and 10%, respectively.",

            "Abstract": "With the ongoing advances in the area of cloud computing, Internet of Things, Industry 4.0, and the increasing prevalence of cyber-physical systems and devices equipped with sensors, the amount of data generated every second is rising steadily. Thereby, the gathering of data and the creation of added value from this data is getting easier and easier. However, the increasing volume of data stored in the cloud leads to new challenges. Analytics software and scalable platforms are required to evaluate the data distributed all over the internet. But with distributed applications and large data sets to be handled, the network becomes a bottleneck. Therefore, in this work, we present an approach to automatically improve the deployment of such applications regarding the placement of data processing components dependent on the data flow of the application. To show the practical feasibility of our approach, we implemented a prototype based on the open-source ecosystem OpenTOSCA. Moreover, we evaluated our prototype using various scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "The post-discharge support is increasingly suggested for stroke patients to be discharged earlier and start rehabilitation at home. Considering that stroke patients usually have a high chance of recurrence, a good prognostic program is essential to improve diagnostic capabilities while reducing readmission rate to further save medical sources. In this context, various machine learning methods have been leveraged to obtain diagnostic findings and guide further treatments. However, those approaches mainly focus on performing analysis using a single data source obtained from the hospital, which could ignore the information complementarity between different groups of features and several subtle and discrete differences of physical interpretation among them. In this paper, we propose an Edge-based system design for post-stroke surveillance and warning prediction, called PSMART (Post-Stroke Mobile Auxiliary Rudiment Treatment), for processing enriched pathogenic factors of ischemic stroke from multi-sensors (views) to make readmission warning predictions. Our approach can considerably enrich the distinctive features from raw data, as well as exploit the consistency and complementary proprieties of different views, leading to better learning results. We evaluate the performance of the proposed approach on a real-world dataset, and the accuracy can reach up to 98.98%. Moreover, experiment results also show that our proposed approach can provide better accuracy when compared to the single-view ones.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud platforms offer the same VMs under many purchasing options that specify different costs and time commitments, such as on-demand, reserved, sustained-use, scheduled reserve, transient, and spot block. In general, the stronger the commitment, i.e., longer and less flexible, the lower the price. However, longer and less flexible time commitments can increase cloud costs for users if future workloads cannot utilize the VMs they committed to buying. Large cloud customers often find it challenging to choose the right mix of purchasing options to reduce their long-term costs, while retaining the ability to adjust capacity up and down in response to workload variations.To address the problem, we design policies to optimize long-term cloud costs by selecting a mix of VM purchasing options based on short- and long-term expectations of workload utilization. We consider a batch trace spanning 4 years from a large shared cluster for a major state University system that includes 14k cores and 60 million job submissions, and evaluate how these jobs could be judiciously executed using cloud servers using our approach. Our results show that our policies incur a cost within 41% of an optimistic optimal offline approach, and 50% less than solely using on-demand VMs.",

            "Abstract": "Job scheduling in cluster is often considered as a difficult online decision-making problem, and its solution depends largely on the understanding of the workload and environment. People usually first propose a simple heuristic scheduling algorithm, and then perform repeated and tedious manual tests and adjustments based on the characteristics of the workload to gradually improve the algorithm. In this work, focusing on multi-cluster environments, load balancing and efficient scheduling, we present RLSK, a deep reinforcement learning based job scheduler for scheduling independent batch jobs among multiple federated cloud computing clusters adaptively. By directly specifying high-level scheduling targets, RLSK interacts with the system environment and automatically learns scheduling strategies from experience without any prior knowledge assumed over the underlying multi-cluster environment and human instructions, which avoids people‚Äôs tedious testing and tuning work. We implement our scheduler based on Kubernetes, and conduct simulations to evaluate the performance of our design. The results show that, RLSK can outperform traditional scheduling algorithms.",

            "Abstract": "Blockchain, as a promising solution to develop secure distributed ledgers, has drawn a huge attention over the last decade. By introducing a pseudonymous payment model with no central authority, blockchain marked the new generation of online payment systems, known as Cryptocurrencies. For most of the existing cryptocurrencies, scalability has become a challenging problem. When dealing with an ever increasing number of users, miners, and transactions, the technology is unable to scale and provide the same performance as centralised systems (e.g. centralised payment systems).Without addressing this fundamental scalability problem, such a promising technology may not be able to be adopted in mainstream. This paper provides an attempt to analyse the scalability of existing blockchain protocols and look at the major factors affecting scalability, namely throughput and latency. We also describe the HTNZ protocol, a new approach to improve the scalability of Satoshi Nakamoto‚Äôs model [1], validated by experimental results. HTNZ introduces two new components, namely, sideBlock and helper. SideBlock has a slightly different structure of block and increases the number of transactions that can be processed per each interval.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing offers a model where resources (storage, applications, etc.) are abstracted and provided ‚Äúas-aservice‚Äù in a remotely accessible manner. Although there are numerous claimed benefits of the Cloud to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the stored data, the number of security breaches is still on the rise. The lack of security assurance and transparency prevented customers/enterprises from trusting the Cloud Service Providers (CSPs). Unless the customer‚Äôs security requirements are identified and documented by the CSPs, customers can not be assured that the CSPs will satisfy their requirements. Furthermore, the customer‚Äôs compensation upon a violation is a manual time intensive process.In this paper we address the aforementioned challenges by proposing a decentralized customer-based monitoring approach running over Ethereum blockchain. The proposed approach allows the customer(s) to validate the compliance of CSP(s) to the contracted services in the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and ‚Äúautonomsly‚Äù compensate customers in case of security breaches. At the same time, the proposed approach prevents customers from misreporting for financial gain. The approach builds upon the Ethereum blockchain infrastructure in order to securely store monitoring logs and incorporate SLAs as smart contracts. The compliance validation framework is implemented and its functionality is evaluated on Amazon EC2 and Ethereum Blockchain.",
            "TLDR": "A decentralized customer-based monitoring approach that allows the customer to validate the compliance of CSP(s) to the contracted services in the Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and compensate customers in case of security breaches and prevents customers from misreporting for financial gain is proposed."

            "Abstract": "As serverless computing gains popularity among developers for its low costing and elasticity, it has emerged as a promising research field in computer science. Despite its popularity, the cold start remains an issue that needs more attention. In this paper, we address the cold start problem of the serverless platform. We propose WLEC, a container management architecture to minimize the cold start time. WLEC uses a modified S2LRU structure, called S2LRU ++ with an additional third queue. We implement WLEC in OpenLambda and evaluate it in both AWS and Local VM environment with six different metrics in addition to one real-time image resizing application. Among improvements in all metrics, 50% less memory consumption compared to the all-warm method and 31% average cold start duration reduction compared to the no-warm method are the most notable ones.",
            "TLDR": "This paper proposes WLEC, a container management architecture to minimize the cold start time of the serverless platform, and implements it in OpenLambda and evaluates it in both AWS and Local VM environment."

Serverless suggests not (or less) caring about servers but focusing (more) on business logic expressed in functions. Server‚Äôless‚Äô may be ‚Äòmore‚Äô when getting developer expectations and platform propositions right and when engineering solutions that take specific behavior and constraints of (current) Function-as-a-Service platforms into account. To this end, in this invited paper, we present a summary of findings and lessons learned from a series of research experiments conducted over the past two years. We argue that careful attention must be placed on the promises associated with the serverless model, provide a reality-check for five common assumptions, and suggest ways to mitigate unwanted effects. Our findings focus on application workload distribution and computational processing complexity, the specific auto-scaling mechanisms in place, the behavior and strategies implemented with operational tasks, the constraints and limitations existing when composing functions, and the costs of executing functions.",

While these innovations have helped reduce performance overhead when simulating a computer, considerable performance loss is still possible in the public cloud from resource contention of co-located VMs. In this paper, we investigate the extent of performance degradation from resource contention by leveraging well-known benchmarks run in parallel across three generations of virtualization hypervisors. Using a Python-based test harness we orchestrate execution of CPU, disk, and network I/O bound benchmarks across up to 48 VMs sharing the same Amazon Web Services dedicated host server. We found that executing benchmarks on hosts with many idle Linux VMs produced unexpected performance degradation. As public cloud users are interested in avoiding resource contention from co-located VMs, we next leveraged our dedicated host performance measurements as independent variables to train models to predict the number of co-resident VMs. We evaluated multiple linear regression and random forest models using test data from independent benchmark runs across 96 vCPU dedicated hosts running up to 48 x 2 vCPU VMs where we controlled VM placements. Multiple linear regression over normalized data achieved R2=.942, with mean absolute error of VM co-residency predictions of ¬±1.61 VMs. We then leveraged our models to infer VM co-residency among a set of 50 VMs on the public cloud, where co-location data is unavailable. Here models cannot be independently verified, but results suggest the relative occupancy level of public cloud hosts enabling users to infer when their VMs reside on busy hosts. Our results characterize how recent hypervisor and hardware advancements are addressing resource contention, while demonstrating the potential to leverage co-located benchmarks for VM co-residency prediction in a public cloud.",
            "TLDR": "This paper investigates the extent of performance degradation from resource contention by leveraging well-known benchmarks run in parallel across three generations of virtualization hypervisors and characterize how recent hypervisor and hardware advancements are addressing resource contention, while demonstrating the potential to leverage co-located benchmarks for VM co-residency prediction in a public cloud."

The state-of-the-art for such operations implements agent-based approaches to inspect the provisioned software stack for security and compliance issues. However, this approach, which runs agents on the systems being analyzed, is vulnerable to some attacks, can incur substantial performance impact, and can introduce significant complexity. In this paper, we present the design and prototype implementation of a general-purpose approach for Non-intrusive Software Introspection (NSI). By adhering to NSI, organizations hosting in the cloud can as well control the software introspection workflow with reduced trust in the provider. Experimental analysis of real-world applications demonstrates that NSI presents a lightweight and scalable approach, and has a negligible impact on the performance of applications running on the instance being introspected.",

While existing (microbenchmark) frameworks only evaluate single aspects of FaaS platforms, a more holistic, application-driven approach is still missing. In this paper, we design and present BeFaaS, an extensible application-centric benchmarking framework for FaaS environments that focuses on the evaluation of FaaS platforms through realistic and typical examples of FaaS applications. BeFaaS includes a built-in e-commerce benchmark, is extensible for new workload profiles and new platforms, supports federated benchmark runs in which the benchmark application is distributed over multiple providers, and supports a fine-grained result analysis. Our evaluation compares three major FaaS providers in single cloud provider setups and shows that BeFaaS is capable of running each benchmark automatically with minimal configuration effort and providing detailed insights for each interaction.",

            "Abstract": "The use of containers within cloud environments has become increasing popular due to their lightweight nature, scalability, and efficiency. However, as containers share their host's resources, advanced resource management techniques are essential to avoid performance impacting resource contention. Coarse measures such as CPU, disk, and network usage collected from internal agents are often considered, yet these methods may be improved upon to garner a more precise view of container workloads. In this paper, we present a container workload characterization method using host system tracing. Features derived from thread execution states are taken from tracing data to reveal container runtime behaviour. A PageRank-based algorithm is then used to identify the most significant threads for further analysis. Once this data is collected and vectorized, a two stage K-Means clustering technique is used to generate groups of containers with similar workloads. This eliminates the need for manual analysis of individual containers, and instead allows administrators to view and address container behaviours collectively. Experimental results show that our methodology can identify a variety of execution behaviours. Administrators may use these results to remove idle containers to free up system resources. Moreover, they may identify clusters of containers that are at risk of resource contention, allowing for more effective resource assignment.",
            "TLDR": "This paper presents a container workload characterization method using host system tracing that eliminates the need for manual analysis of individual containers, and instead allows administrators to view and address container behaviours collectively."

            "Abstract": "EdgeAI (Edge computing based Artificial Intelligence) has been most actively researched for the last few years to handle variety of massively distributed AI applications to meet up the strict latency requirements. Meanwhile, many companies have released edge devices with smaller form factors (low power consumption and limited resources) like the popular Raspberry Pi and Nvidia's Jetson Nano for acting as compute nodes at the edge computing environments. Although the edge devices are limited in terms of computing power and hardware resources, they are powered by accelerators to enhance their performance behavior. Therefore, it is interesting to see how AI-based Deep Neural Networks perform on such devices with limited resources. In this work, we present and compare the performance in terms of inference time and power consumption of the four SoCs: Asus Tinker Edge R, Raspberry Pi 4, Google Coral Dev Board, Nvidia Jetson Nano, and one microcontroller: Arduino Nano 33 BLE, on different deep learning models and frameworks. We also provide a method for measuring power consumption, inference time and accuracy for the devices, which can be easily extended to other devices. Our results showcase that, for Tensorflow based quantized model, the Google Coral Dev Board delivers the best performance, both for inference time and power consumption. For a low fraction of inference computation time, i.e. less than 29.3% of the time for MobileNetV2, the Jetson Nano performs faster than the other devices.",

            "Abstract": "The growing number of data- and latency-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications is posing significant challenges for the edge and cloud deployment of publish/subscribe services, which are required by these applications. Two independently developed technologies show promise in addressing these challenges. First, Kubernetes (K8s) provides a de-facto standard for container orchestration that can manage and scale distributed applications in the cloud. Second, OMG's Data Distribution Service (DDS), a standardized real-time, data-centric and peer-to-peer publish/subscribe middleware, is being used in thousands of critical systems around the world. However, the feasibility of running DDS applications within K8s for latency-sensitive edge computing, and specifically the performance overhead of K8s' network virtualization on DDS applications is not yet well-understood. To address this, in this paper we evaluate the performance overhead of several container network interface (CNI) plugins including Flannel, WeaveNet and Kube-Router installed on a hybrid (ARM+AMD) edge/cloud K8s cluster. The paper reports results from a comprehensive set of experiments conducted to measure and analyze the performance (throughput, latency, and CPU/memory usage) of containerized DDS applications from the perspectives of virtualization overhead, reliability (DDS Reliable and BestEffort QoS), transport mechanisms (UDP unicast and multicast), and security. The insights derived from this study provide concrete guidance to developers of DDS-based applications in choosing the right virtual network plugin and configurations when hosting their real-time IoT applications in real-world containerized environments.",

Public cloud providers offer a large variety and quantity of resources that can be used for such clusters. Yet, selecting appropriate cloud resources for dataflow jobs - that neither lead to bottlenecks nor to low resource utilization - is often challenging, even for expert users such as data engineers. We present C3O, a collaborative system for optimizing data processing cluster configurations in public clouds based on shared historical runtime data. The shared data is utilized for predicting the runtimes of data processing jobs on different possible cluster configurations, using specialized regression models. These models take the diverse execution contexts of different users into account and exhibit mean absolute errors below 3% in our experimental evaluation with 930 unique Spark jobs.",

            "Abstract": "Containers are an attractive platform for developing and deploying applications. Unfortunately, in order to start up a new or updated container, the entire container image must first be pulled from a registry, increasing the waiting time for containers to actually become available. Various methods have been proposed to accelerate container startup with lazy pull of container images. However, these methods have compatibility problems with existing container ecosystems, which is a major obstacle to their deployment in production environments. In this paper, we propose a fast container startup system with lazy layer pull that is highly compatible with existing container ecosystems. Our approach is to add a boot layer with only the minimum files required for booting on top of the existing container image, and to introduce a carefully designed overlay file system called LlpFS that allows for lazy pull of layers while conforming to the specifications and de facto standards of the container ecosystem. Evaluation in practical applications showed that our system made container startup about 4.9√ó faster under 1 Gbps bandwidth with little performance overhead.",

            "Abstract": "As the popularity and relevance of the Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) model keeps growing, we believe newer avatars of the service will support computationally intensive SIMT functions that will execute on GPUs. With hardware-assisted virtualization of GPUs now possible, cloud offerings including GPUs usually bind a virtual GPU (vGPU) to a VM. While there is a choice of scheduling algorithms to multiplex vGPUs on to the physical GPU, the work-conserving best-effort scheduler helps to maintain a high level of utilization of the GPU. With this, we observe that the total share of the GPU per VM is non-deterministic and depends on how different VMs load the GPU via their vGPUs. As a result, any function-to-vGPU scheduler that does not explicitly account for this nondeterministic vGPU capacity will suffer from lower than optimal goodput - particularly when these functions are deadline bound as is the case with FaaS offerings today. In this work, we exploit a software based task slicing technique to dynamically determine task sizes for scheduling on vGPUs to maximize successful completion of functions within their deadlines. Our solution extends the conventional earliest-deadline first (EDF) scheduling algorithm by balancing scheduling opportunities (via kernel slicing) and maximizing the chances of functions finishing before their deadline. The work is motivated by the fact that static decisions that consider entire tasks as scheduling units or use a fixed, statically decided slice size as scheduling units cannot adapt to the non-deterministic vGPU capacity. A comparison of our solution with well-known deadline aware scheduling approach (earliest deadline first), yielded an improvement of up to 2.9x in goodput.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless applications can be particularly difficult to troubleshoot, as these applications are often composed of various managed and partly managed services. Faults are often unpredictable and can occur at multiple points, even in simple compositions. Each additional function or service in a serverless composition introduces a new possible fault source and a new layer to obfuscate faults. Currently, serverless platforms offer only limited support for identifying runtime faults. Developers looking to observe their serverless compositions often have to rely on scattered logs and ambiguous error messages to pinpoint root causes. In this paper, we investigate the use of distributed tracing for improving the observability of faults in serverless applications. To this end, we first introduce a model for characterizing fault observability, then provide a prototypical tracing implementation-specifically, a developer-driven and a platform-supported tracing approach. We compare both approaches with our model, measure associated trade-offs (execution latency, resource utilization), and contribute new insights for troubleshooting serverless compositions.",

            "Abstract": "Distributed Stream Processing (DSP) systems enable processing large streams of continuous data to produce results in near to real time. They are an essential part of many data-intensive applications and analytics platforms. The rate at which events arrive at DSP systems can vary considerably over time, which may be due to trends, cyclic, and seasonal patterns within the data streams. A priori knowledge of incoming workloads enables proactive approaches to resource management and optimization tasks such as dynamic scaling, live migration of resources, and the tuning of configuration parameters during run-times, thus leading to a potentially better Quality of Service. In this paper we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of different load prediction techniques for DSP jobs. We identify three use-cases and formulate requirements for making load predictions specific to DSP jobs. Automatically optimized classical and Deep Learning methods are being evaluated on nine different datasets from typical DSP domains, i.e. the IoT, Web 2.0, and cluster monitoring. We compare model performance with respect to overall accuracy and training duration. Our results show that the Deep Learning methods provide the most accurate load predictions for the majority of the evaluated datasets.",

            "Abstract": "Cloud computing provides a powerful yet low-cost environment for distributed deep learning workloads. However, training complex deep learning models often requires accessing large amounts of data, which can easily exceed the capacity of local disks. Prior research often overlooks this training data problem by implicitly assuming that data is available locally or via low latency network-based data storage. Such implicit assumptions often do not hold in a cloud-based training environment, where deep learning practitioners create and tear down dedicated GPU clusters on demand, or do not have the luxury of local storage, such as in serverless workloads. In this work, we investigate the performance of distributed training that leverages training data residing entirely inside cloud storage buckets. These buckets promise low storage costs, but come with inherent bandwidth limitations that make them seem unsuitable for an efficient training solution. To account for these bandwidth limitations, we propose the use of two classical techniques, namely caching and pre-fetching, to mitigate the training performance degradation. We implement a prototype, DELI, based on the popular deep learning framework PyTorch by building on its data loading abstractions. We then evaluate the training performance of two deep learning workloads using Google Cloud's NVIDIA K80 GPU servers and show that we can reduce the time that the training loop is waiting for data by 85.6%-93.5% compared to loading directly from a storage bucket-thus achieving comparable performance to loading data directly from disk-while only storing a fraction of the data locally at a time. In addition, DELI has the potential of lowering the cost of running a training workload, especially on models with long per-epoch training times.",

            "Abstract": "Recently, many data analytics systems have focused on adopting a newly emerging compute resource, serverless, which offers scalability and agility to deal with peak workloads in a timely and cost-efficient manner, i.e., serverless data analytics (SDA). Unfortunately, these systems may encounter a cost bottleneck ($) because they have ignored the per unit time cost ($) of serverless, which is more expensive by up to 5.8 times for the same compute capacity than a traditional compute resource such as a virtual machine (VM). In addition, SDA may also encounter a performance bottleneck due to serverless' worse performance than VM. In this paper, we first study and report when serverless is beneficial for data analytics. Then, we present a scalable compute cost-aware data analytics system, Cocoa, that exploits serverless and VM together to achieve composite benefits. A Cocoa prototype was implemented on Spark. Evaluation results show a richer cost-performance tradeoff space opened by exploiting heterogeneous compute resources together, and identify substantial opportunities for future serverless-enabled systems research.",

            "Abstract": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) may be partitioned across the edge and the cloud to improve the performance efficiency of inference. DNN partitions are determined based on operational conditions such as network speed. When operational conditions change DNNs will need to be repartitioned to maintain the overall performance. However, repartitioning using existing approaches, such as Pause and Resume, will incur a service downtime on the edge. This paper presents the NEUKONFIG framework that identifies the service downtime incurred when repartitioning DNNs and proposes approaches for reducing edge service downtime. The proposed approaches are based on ‚ÄòDynamic Switching‚Äô in which, when the network speed changes and given an existing edge-cloud pipeline, a new edge-cloud pipeline is initialised with new DNN partitions. Incoming inference requests are switched to the new pipeline for processing data. Experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed to demonstrate that Dynamic Switching reduces the downtime by at least an order of magnitude when compared to a baseline using Pause and Resume that has a downtime of 6 seconds. A trade-off in the edge service downtime and memory required is noted. The Dynamic Switching approach that requires the same amount of memory as the baseline reduces the edge service downtime to 0.6 seconds and to less than 1 millisecond in the best case when twice the amount of memory as the baseline is available.",

            "Abstract": "The Internet of Things (IoT) has enabled an abundance of geographically distributed physical devices or ‚Äúthings‚Äù equipped with sensors and actuators to exchange information with the Cloud. However, this paradigm remains largely under-exploited for real-time analytic applications. The benefit of realtime data acquisition at the Edge becomes fruitless as it is not readily accessible to more powerful data analytic tools in the Cloud due to wide-area network delays. In this paper, we present VRebalance, a virtual resource orchestrator that provides an end-to-end performance guarantee for concurrent stream processing workloads at the Edge. VRebalance employs Bayesian Optimization $\\mathcal{BO}$ to quickly identify near-optimal resource configurations. Experimental results with a real-time open-source IoT benchmark for Distributed Stream Processing Platforms (RIoTBench) and a representative stream processing engine (Apache Storm) demonstrate the superior performance, resource efficiency and adaptiveness of our $\\mathcal{BO}$-based resource management system. VRebalance meets the performance SLO (service level objective) targets for stream processing workloads even in the presence of acute system dynamics. It decreases the SLO violation rate by at least 34% for static workloads and by 62.5% for dynamic workloads compared to a hill climbing method. Compared to Storm's default resource scaling mechanism, our method decreases the SLO violation rate by 83.7%.",

            "Abstract": "Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) has recently emerged to reduce the deployment cost of running cloud applications compared to Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). FaaS follows a serverless ‚Äúpay-as-you-go‚Äù computing model; it comes at a higher cost per unit of execution time but typically application functions experience lower provisioning time (startup delay). IaaS requires the provisioning of Virtual Machines, which typically suffer from longer cold-start delays that cause higher queuing delays and higher request drop rates. We present LIBRA, a balanced (hybrid) approach that leverages both VM-based and serverless resources to efficiently manage cloud resources for the applications. LIBRA closely monitors the application demand and provisions appropriate VM and serverless resources such that the running cost is minimized and Service-Level Agreements are met. Unlike state of the art, LIBRA not only hides VM cold-start delays, and hence reduces response time, by leveraging serverless, but also directs a low-rate bursty portion of the demand to serverless where it would be less costly than spinning up new VMs. We evaluate LIBRA on real traces in a simulated environment as well as on the AWS commercial cloud. Our results show that LIBRA outperforms other resource-provisioning policies, including a recent hybrid approach - LIBRA achieves more than 85% reduction in SLA violations and up to 53% cost savings.",

            "Abstract": "The use of virtualization techniques, such as containerization, is rapidly changing how the deployment of applications is performed at the network edge. Indeed, container images enable fast instantiation and small footprint. However, although having smaller size than VMs virtual disks, container images continue to have hundreds of megabytes and can take several seconds to be downloaded in an edge node. In fact, the heterogeneity and resource-constrained infrastructure, typical of an edge computing scenario, can also increase this latency, by the several bottlenecks that may occur on the network topology. We advocate that the use of well-positioned container registries on the topology can significantly improve the deployment process. To prove that, in this paper we focus our analysis on the network requirements of large amounts of container deployments, and the impact generated on two distinct edge topologies. We also present a new registries placement solution based on a fluid communities algorithm. We validated our proposal using simulation and results show that it validates the model and generality of the proposed solution, showing enhanced performance even with biased schedulers with large amounts of deployments in a concentrated set of nodes.",

            "Abstract": "With the advent of the Big Data era, it is usually computationally expensive to calculate the resource usages of a SQL query with traditional DBMS approaches. Can we estimate the cost of each query more efficiently without any computation in a SQL engine kernel? Can machine learning techniques help to estimate SQL query resource utilization? The answers are yes. We propose a SQL query cost predictor service, which employs machine learning techniques to train models from historical query request logs and rapidly forecasts the CPU and memory resource usages of online queries without any computation in a SQL engine. At Twitter, infrastructure engineers are maintaining a large-scale SQL federation system across on-premises and cloud data centers for serving ad-hoc queries. The proposed service can help to improve query scheduling by relieving the issue of imbalanced online analytical processing (OLAP) workloads in the SQL engine clusters. It can also assist in enabling preemptive scaling. Additionally, the proposed approach uses plain SQL statements for the model training and online prediction, indicating it is both hardware and software-agnostic. The method can be generalized to broader SQL systems and heterogeneous environments. The models can achieve 97.9% accuracy for CPU usage prediction and 97% accuracy for memory usage prediction.",

            "Abstract": "Latency and privacy concerns, together with the spread of IoT devices, have recently sparked interest in edge computing and computational offloading to the edge and beyond. Portability and migratability are important requirements to achieve a stable edge femtocloud offloading platform. Due to the inherent heterogeneity of the edge, code compatibility is one of the core challenges towards achieving those goals. In this paper, we examine how popular technologies achieve portability and migratability, and the advantages and limitations of each method in light of established standards and current research. We argue that WebAssembly has many advantages as a platform for femtocloud offloading. Next, we implement Nomad, an interpreter-based environment, to run WebAssembly that is capable of live-migrating across operating systems and hardware architectures. We evaluate Nomad and examine the effect of migration on performance, startup and migration delays, and cross-platform migration. We find that migration, even cross-platform, adds less than 5% overhead to performance and fixed delays are less than 2ms in most scenarios.",
            "TLDR": "It is argued that WebAssembly has many advantages as a platform for femtocloud offloading and Nomad, an interpreter-based environment, is implemented to run WebAssembly that is capable of live-migrating across operating systems and hardware architectures."

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate how to automatically persist versioned data structures in distributed settings (e.g. cloud + edge) using append-only storage. By doing so, we facilitate resiliency by enabling program state to survive program activations and termination, and program-level data structures and their version information to be accessed programmatically by multiple clients (for replay, provenance tracking, debugging, and coordination avoidance, and more). These features are useful in distributed, failure-prone contexts such as those for heterogeneous and pervasive Internet of Things (IoT) deployments. We prototype our approach within an open-source, distributed operating system for IoT. Our results show that it is possible to achieve algorithmic complexities similar to those of in-memory versioning but in a distributed setting.",

To achieve this, we synergize cloud and edge environments. We experimentally validate our framework on a forecasting air quality situation.

Training such a model typically requires stochastic gradient descent, and the process is time-consuming and expensive in terms of computing resources. In this paper, we propose a distributed framework that supports the prioritized execution of the gradient computation. Our proposed distributed framework identifies important data points through computing or estimating the priority for each data point. We evaluate the proposed distributed framework with several machine learning models including multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and convolutional neural networks (CNN). Our experimental results show that prioritized SGD accelerates the training of machine learning models by as much as 1.6X over that of the mini-batch SGD. Further, the distributed framework scales linearly with the number of workers.",

            "Abstract": "With increasing digitization, more and more people use their identification credentials for accessing online services; which increases concern for data privacy. To ensure user's privacy, alternate credential management schemes must be adopted. Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) is a form of credential management where users are in charge of their credentials. Privacy-critical data is stored at the user's end and they can choose to do selective disclosure of minimal required information to access services. Currently, SSI solutions are not being widely adopted by service providers and the ecosystem is fragmented. One of the reasons for the lack of adoption is the need for maintaining private infrastructure for credential issuance, as critical user information is to be handled during credential issuance. To cater to this, we present a solution that enables the service providers to run their credential issuers on public cloud - a so-called Credentials as a Service (CaaS). CaaS issuers run inside Trusted Execution Environments (TEE) enabling credential issuers to ensure user's privacy while enjoying the flexibility of the pay-per-use cloud model. CaaS can pave the way for making SSI credentials ubiquitous in identity management solutions.",

            "Abstract": "6G networks are envisioned to be trustworthy systems that can self-maintain their reliability and service availability. The ability to automatically recognize and predict any faults or failures that occur while delivering services is a step towards realizing such systems. Real-time analytics based on Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML) techniques provides the required functionality. However, in the highly dynamic and complex environment of 6G services, the distribution of data feeding to the ML models is subject to change over time (i.e., concept drift), which makes persistent model accuracy challenging without any frequent model retraining. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a system that predicts the faults in an edge cloud environment, where the prediction models are trained and automatically adapted to the concept drifts via Transfer Learning (TL). To present the effectiveness of our system, we implemented an edge cloud testbed and introduced CPU over-utilization and network congestion fault to it in the presence of concept drift. We used Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and a combination of them as fault prediction models. For detecting the drifts, we have implemented and compared four drift detection methods, and we utilized three TL scenarios for adapting the model to the drift. Our results indicate the superiority of our system in maintaining a persistent accuracy in the presence of concept drift compared to a prediction system without a drift handling entity.",

            "Abstract": "Ever since the commercial offerings of the Cloud started appearing in 2006, the landscape of cloud computing has been undergoing remarkable changes with the emergence of many different types of service offerings, developer productivity enhancement tools, and new application classes as well as the manifestation of cloud functionality closer to the user at the edge. The notion of utility computing, however, has remained constant throughout its evolution, which means that cloud users always seek to save costs of leasing cloud resources while maximizing their use. On the other hand, cloud providers try to maximize their profits while assuring service-level objectives of the cloud-hosted applications and keeping operational costs low. All these outcomes require systematic and sound cloud engineering principles. The aim of this paper is to highlight the importance of cloud engineering, survey the landscape of best practices in cloud engineering and its evolution, discuss many of the existing cloud engineering advances, and identify both the inherent technical challenges and research opportunities for the future of cloud computing in general and cloud engineering in particular.",

            "Abstract": "The growing research and industry interest in the Internet of Things and the edge computing paradigm has increased the need for cost-efficient virtual testbeds for large-scale distributed applications. Researchers, students, and practitioners need to test and evaluate the interplay of hundreds or thousands of real software components and services connected with a realistic edge network without access to phvsical infrastructure. While advances in virtualization technologies have enabled parts of this, network emulation as a crucial part in the development of edge testbeds is lagging behind: As we show in this paper, NetEm, the current state-of-the-art network emulation tooling included in the Linux kernel, imposes prohibitive scalability limits. We quantify these limits, investigate possible causes, and present a way forward for network emulation in large-scale virtual edge testbeds based on eBPFs.",

            "Abstract": "Use-cases in the Internet of Things (IoT) typically involve a high number of interconnected, heterogeneous devices. Due to the criticality of many IoT scenarios, systems and applications need to be tested thoroughly before rollout. Existing staging environments and testing frameworks are able to emulate network properties but fail to deliver actual network-wide traffic control to test systems application independently. To extend existing frameworks, we present the distributed traffic replaying tool IoTreeplay. The tool embeds TCPLivePlay into an environment that allows the synchronous replaying of network traffic with multiple endpoints and connections. Replaying takes place in a user-defined network or testbed containing IoT use-cases. Network traffic can be captured and compared to the original trace to evaluate accuracy and reliability. The resulting implementation is able to accurately replay connections within a maximum transmission rate but struggles with deviations from regular TCP connections, like packet loss or connection reset. An evaluation has been performed, measuring individual and aggregated delays between packets, based on the recorded timestamps.",
            "TLDR": "The distributed traffic replaying tool IoTreeplay is presented, which embeds TCPLivePlay into an environment that allows the synchronous replaying of network traffic with multiple endpoints and connections and is able to accurately replay connections within a maximum transmission rate."

            "Abstract": "Distributed systems pervade the everyday life and become more relevant for efficiency and comfort, but also safety. Their development is challenged by increasing heterogeneity of hardware, software, and the increased need for interaction and compatibility. For instance, for vehicular communication in Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs), WiFi and cellular based technologies (ITS-G5 and C-V2X) compete and co-exist. We ad-dress end-to-end testing of such highly connected applications in combination with hardware and complex environments. Related testbeds cover many aspects but lack support to integrate virtual nodes, physical nodes, and co-simulations all together. This work contributes 1) the integration of Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) simulation using ns-3 into the hybrid co-simulation framework Marvis; 2) the use of C-V2X on a software-defined radio (SDR) for ITS scenarios in Marvis; 3) an integration of the aforementioned with the competing V2X standard ITS-5G. The evaluation of this open source implementation is based on a currently relevant use case of the DiAK project, a digitized railroad crossing, in which both simulated and physical C-V2X communication are included in the scenario. The measured values recorded in the process show that Marvis can be used for developing and analyzing realistic ITS simulations. The necessary adjustments to the ns-3 C-V2X simulator increase the message transmission latency by only 0.8 ms (or 1.4 %) and can therefore be neglected.",

This end-to-end workflow helps researchers build reproducible environments to evaluate cluster management techniques. Our implementation extends the open source tool Galileo by adding support for distributed execution on Kubernetes clusters, additional system monitoring instruments, as well as out-of-the box experiment workloads. We focus on providing tools that run across popular CPU architectures and provide a set of representative workloads, such as edge AI functions. We demonstrate our framework's capabilities in a set of experiments based on use cases commonly found in edge computing systems research. Additionally, we show that the resource usage of our system is minimal and that it can run on resource-constrained devices.",

            "Abstract": "Energy consumption and carbon emissions are expected to be crucial factors for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. Both the scale and the geo-distribution keep increasing, while Artificial Intelligence (AI) further penetrates the ‚Äúedge‚Äù in order to satisfy the need for highly-responsive and intelligent services. To date, several edge/fog emulators are catering for IoT testing by supporting the deployment and execution of AI-driven IoT services in consolidated test environments. These tools enable the configuration of infrastructures so that they closely resemble edge devices and IoT networks. However, energy consumption and carbon emissions estimations during the testing of AI services are still missing from the current state of IoT testing suites. This study highlights important questions that developers of AI-driven IoT services are in need of answers, along with a set of observations and challenges, aiming to help researchers designing IoT testing and benchmarking suites to cater to user needs.",

            "Abstract": "While cloud computing is the current standard for outsourcing computation, it can be prohibitively expensive for cities and infrastructure operators to deploy services. At the same time, there are underutilized computing resources within cities and local edge-computing deployments. Using these slack resources may enable significantly lower pricing than comparable cloud computing; such resources would incur minimal marginal expenditure since their deployment and operation are mostly sunk costs. However, there are challenges associated with using these resources. First, they are not effectively aggregated or provisioned. Second, there is a lack of trust between customers and suppliers of computing resources, given that they are distinct stakeholders and behave according to their own interests. Third, delays in processing inputs may diminish the value of the applications. To resolve these chal-lenges, we introduce an architecture combining a distributed trusted computing mechanism, such as a blockchain, with an efficient messaging system like Apache Pulsar. Using this architecture, we design a decentralized computation market where customers and suppliers make offers to deploy and host applications. The proposed architecture can be realized using any trusted computing mechanism that supports smart contracts, and any messaging framework with the necessary features. This combination ensures that the market is robust without incurring the input processing delays that limit other blockchain based solutions. We evaluate the market protocol using game-theoretic analysis to show that deviation from the protocol is discouraged. Finally, we assess the performance of a prototype implementation based on experiments with a streaming computer-vision application.",

            "Abstract": "Data stream processing is an increasingly important topic due to the prevalence of smart devices and the demand for real-time analytics. Geo-distributed streaming systems, where cloud-based queries utilize data streams from multiple distributed devices, face challenges since wide-area network (WAN) bandwidth is often scarce or expensive. Edge computing allows us to address these bandwidth costs by utilizing resources close to the devices, e.g. to perform sampling over the incoming data streams, which trades downstream query accuracy to reduce the overall transmission cost. In this paper, we leverage the fact that correlations between data streams may exist across devices located in the same geographical region. Using this insight, we develop a hybrid edge-cloud system which systematically trades off between sampling at the edge and estimation of missing values in the cloud to reduce traffic over the WAN. We present an optimization framework which computes sample sizes at the edge and systematically bounds the number of samples we can estimate in the cloud given the strength of the correlation between streams. Our evaluation with three real-world datasets shows that compared to existing sampling techniques, our system could provide comparable error rates over multiple aggregate queries while reducing WAN traffic by 27-42%.",
            "TLDR": "This paper develops a hybrid edge-cloud system which systematically trades off between sampling at the edge and estimation of missing values in the cloud to reduce traffic over the WAN."

            "Abstract": "Distributed dataflow systems like Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop enable data-parallel processing of large datasets on clusters. Yet, selecting appropriate computational resources for dataflow jobs ‚Äî that neither lead to bottlenecks nor to low resource utilization ‚Äî is often challenging, even for expert users such as data engineers. Further, existing automated approaches to resource selection rely on the assumption that a job is recurring to learn from previous runs or to warrant the cost of full test runs to learn from. However, this assumption often does not hold since many jobs are too unique. Therefore, we present Crispy, a method for optimizing data processing cluster configurations based on job profiling runs with small samples of the dataset on just a single machine. Crispy attempts to extrapolate the memory usage for the full dataset to then choose a cluster configuration with enough total memory. In our evaluation on a dataset with 1031 Spark and Hadoop jobs, we see a reduction of job execution costs by 56% compared to the baseline, while on average spending less than ten minutes on profiling runs per job on a consumer-grade laptop.",

            "Abstract": "In cloud event processing, data generated at the edge is processed in real-time by cloud resources. Both distributed stream processing (DSP) and Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) have been proposed to implement such event processing applications. FaaS emphasizes fast development and easy operation, while DSP emphasizes efficient handling of large data volumes. Despite their architectural differences, both can be used to model and implement loosely-coupled job graphs. In this paper, we consider the selection of FaaS and DSP from a cost perspective. We implement stateless and stateful workflows from the Theodolite benchmarking suite using cloud FaaS and DSP. In an extensive evaluation, we show how application type, cloud service provider, and runtime environment can influence the cost of application deployments and derive decision guidelines for cloud engineers.",

            "Abstract": "The increasing use of hardware processing accelerators tailored for specific applications, such as the Vision Processing Unit (VPU) for image recognition, further increases developers' configuration, development, and management over-head. Developers have successfully used fully automated elastic cloud services such as serverless computing to counter these additional efforts and shorten development cycles for applications running on CPUs. Unfortunately, current cloud solutions do not yet provide these simplifications for applications that require hardware acceleration. However, as the development of special-ized hardware acceleration continues to provide performance and cost improvements, it will become increasingly important to enable ease of use in the cloud. In this paper, we present an initial design and implemen-tation of Hardless, an extensible and generalized serverless computing architecture that can support workloads for arbitrary hardware accelerators. We show how Hardless can scale across different commodity hardware accelerators and support a variety of workloads using the same execution and programming model common in serverless computing today.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless computing increases developer productivity by removing operational concerns such as managing hardware or software runtimes. Developers, however, still need to partition their application into functions, which can be error-prone and adds complexity: Using a small function size where only the smallest logical unit of an application is inside a function maximizes flexibility and reusability. Yet, having small functions leads to invocation overheads, additional cold starts, and may increase cost due to double billing during synchronous invocations. In this paper we present Fusionize, a framework that removes these concerns from developers by automatically fusing the application code into a multi-function orchestration with varying function size. Developers only need to write the application code following a lightweight programming model and do not need to worry how the application is turned into functions. Our framework automatically fuses different parts of the application into functions and manages their interactions. Leveraging monitoring data, the framework optimizes the distribution of application parts to functions to optimize deployment goals such as end-to-end latency and cost. Using two example applications, we show that Fusionizecan automatically and iteratively improve the deployment artifacts of the application.",
            "TLDR": "Fusionize is a framework that removes concerns from developers by automatically fusing the application code into a multi-function orchestration with varying function size and optimizes the distribution of application parts to functions to optimize deployment goals such as end-to-end latency and cost."

            "Abstract": "Serverless computing offers a scalable event-based paradigm for deploying managed cloud-native applications. Function triggers are essential building blocks in serverless, as they initiate any function execution. However, function triggering is insufficiently studied and inherently hard to measure given the distributed, ephemeral, and asynchronous nature of event-based function coordination. To address this gap, we present TriggerBench, a cross-provider benchmark for evaluating serverless function triggers based on distributed tracing. We evaluate the trigger latency (i.e., time to transition between two functions) of eight types of triggers in Microsoft Azure and three in AWS. Our results show that all triggers suffer from long tail latency, storage triggers introduce variable multi-second delays, and HTTP triggers are most suitable for interactive applications. Our insights can guide developers in choosing optimal event or messaging triggers for latency-sensitive applications. Researchers can extend TriggerBench to study the latency, scalability, and reliability of further trigger types and cloud providers.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) platforms often abstract the underlying infrastructure configuration into the single option of specifying a function's memory reservation size. This resource abstraction of coupling configurations options (e.g. vCPUs, memory, disk), combined with the lack of profiling, leaves developers to make ad hoc decisions on how to configure functions. Solutions are needed to mitigate exhaustive brute force searches of large parameter input spaces to find optimal configurations which can incur high costs. To address these challenges, we propose CPU Time Accounting Memory Selection (CPU-TAMS). CPU-TAMS is a workload agnostic memory selection method that utilizes CPU time accounting principles and regression modeling to recommend memory settings that reduce function runtime and subsequently, cost. Comparing CPU-TAMS to eight existing selection methods, we find that CPU-TAMS finds maximum value memory settings with only 8% runtime and 5% cost error compared to brute force testing while only requiring a single profiling run to evaluate function resource requirements. We adapt CPU-TAMS for use on four commercial FaaS platforms demonstrating efficacy to optimize function memory configurations where platforms feature heterogeneous infrastructure management policies.",

            "Abstract": "Serverless (FaaS) architecture is emerging as a paradigm of choice for many application types, including event triggered, query processing, and machine learning (ML). The use of serverless platforms for ML inference is well known, but its applicability for model training is still under exploration. This paper presents an efficient ‚Äúpay-as-you-train‚Äù methodology for training large deep learning models using serverless cloud services for compute and data management. Serverless compute (such as AWS Lambda) and serverless data management systems (such as AWS key-value store DynamoDB) impose restrictions on the computing time and size of the allowed data objects respectively. We present a novel approach for training deep learning models, which overcomes the limitations imposed by the underlying serverless platforms. We also present an analytical model to study the performance and cost involved in training using different data management services (such as AWS object storage S3, in-memory Memcached, and DynamoDB) as a communication channel with serverless platforms. Additionally, we compare the performance and cost of these services available on cloud. Our optimization techniques improve the performance and hence the cost of training by a factor of 1.2x to 5.5x with these services.",

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we investigate extensions for Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs) that permit their use in failure-prone, heterogeneous, resource-constrained, distributed, multi-tier (cloud/edge/device) cloud deployments such as the Internet-of-Things (IoT), while addressing multiple CRDT limitations. Specifically, we employ distributed logging to implement robust, strong eventual consistency of replicas. Our approach also enables uniform reversal of operations and precludes the requirement of exactly-once delivery and idempotence imposed by operation-based CRDTs. Moreover, it exposes CRDT versions for use in debugging and history-based programming. We evaluate our approach for commonly used CRDTs and show that it enables higher operation throughput (up to 1.8x) versus conventional CRDTs for the workloads we consider.",

            "Abstract": "In recent years cloud storage services have gained much attention and become a commodity to companies and private users. Nevertheless, cloud storage services have some limitations, especially related to privacy, latency, and availability. In this work we propose a distributed storage system which tackles the major limitations of classical cloud storage services. To this end, we design and implement a storage system which combines classical cloud storage services with the approach of fog computing by using resources at the edge of the network. At the core of our system lies a placement strategy which distributes the data to different storage components. Our implementation is based on well-established methods and techniques from information theory and cryptography. Our empirical analysis shows that our system preserves privacy, provides low latency, and offers high availability. Most notably, we reduce the latency by up to 42% in Upload Mode and even by up to 76% in Download Mode compared to a cloud-only solution.",
            "TLDR": "This work designs and implements a storage system which combines classical cloud storage services with the approach of fog computing by using resources at the edge of the network and shows that the system preserves privacy, provides low latency, and offers high availability."

            "Abstract": "Distributed file systems are widely used nowadays, yet using their default configurations is often not optimal. At the same time, tuning configuration parameters is typically challenging and time-consuming. It demands expertise and tuning operations can also be expensive. This is especially the case for static parameters, where changes take effect only after a restart of the system or workloads. We propose a novel approach, Magpie, which utilizes deep re-inforcement learning to tune static parameters by strategically ex-ploring and exploiting configuration parameter spaces. To boost the tuning of the static parameters, our method employs both server and client metrics of distributed file systems to understand the relationship between static parameters and performance. Our empirical evaluation results show that Magpie can noticeably improve the performance of the distributed file system Lustre, where our approach on average achieves 91.8 % throughput gains against default configuration after tuning towards single performance indicator optimization, while it reaches 39.7% more throughput gains against the baseline.",

            "Abstract": "Object Storage solutions are typically optimised for capacity and cost but performance has traditionally been a second thought. We make the case for a highly performant distributed object store by a) building an abstraction layer to pass immutability and data affinity hints to the underlying storage while also, b) making the Objects layer aware of the hardware configurations enabling the Object Storage controllers to maximise throughput. With these optimizations we show that object storage performance can approach 95% of the maximum possible performance from the underlying raw storage while ensuring that the abstractions are generic enough to be able to run on any general purpose off the shelf storage systems. We have observed these performance gains across more than 1000 customer environments across diverse hardware. We also extend the above optimizations with generic mecha-nisms to offload compute closer to storage that have significant benefits for a broad class of workloads. Specifically, we evaluate performance gains from a) well known constructs like S3 Select for Analytics workloads and b) generic compute offload like Objects Lambda. This ability to offload compute is critical for modern distributed workloads like AI/ML and Analytics processing with very large distributed data sets.",

            "Abstract": "State-of-the-art, scalable, indexing techniques in location-based image data retrieval are primarily focused on supporting window and range queries. However, support of these indexes is not well explored when there are multiple spatially similar images to retrieve for a given geographic location. Adoption of existing spatial indexes such as the kD-tree pose major scalability impediments. In response, this work proposes a novel scalable, key-value, database oriented, secondary-memory based, spatial index to retrieve the top $k$ most spatially similar images to a given geographic location. The proposed index introduces a 4-dimensional Hilbert index (4DHI). This space filling curve is implemented atop HBase (a key-value database). Experiments performed on both synthetically generated and real world data demonstrate comparable accuracy with MD-HBase (a state of the art, scalable, multidimensional point data management system) and better performance. Specifically, 4DHI yielded 34% - 39% storage improvements compared to the disk consumption of the original index of MD-HBase. The compactness in 4DHI also yielded up to 3.4 and 4.7 fold gains when retrieving 6400 and 12800 neighbours, respectively; compared to the adoption of original index of MD-HBase for respective neighbour searches. An optimization technique termed ‚ÄúBounding Box Displacement‚Äù (BBD) is introduced to improve the accuracy of the top $k$ approximations in relation to the results of in-memory kD-tree. Finally, a method of reducing row key length is also discussed for the proposed 4DHI to further improve the storage efficiency and scalability in managing large numbers of remotely sensed images.",
            "TLDR": "The proposed index introduces a 4-dimensional Hilbert index (4DHI) implemented atop HBase (a key-value database), and an optimization technique termed ‚ÄúBounding Box Displacement‚Äù (BBD) is introduced to improve the accuracy of the top $k$ approximations in relation to the results of in-memory kD-tree."

            "Abstract": "Software visualizations are used by software developers, for instance, for program comprehension. In this context, a less researched aspect is the collaborative use of online visual-ization services. This paper presents the conceptual design and a prototype implementation of our approach for a collaborative software visualization service for program comprehension. The central idea is an online available software-as-a-service application that analyzes, persists, and visualizes software applications which users intend to explore and comprehend via software visualization. The resulting implementation is a redevelopment of our live trace visualization tool Explor Viz. In comparison to other approaches, ExplorViz utilizes WebGL and other browser technologies instead of a game engine to render its visualizations. As a result, we achieve a platform-independent interoperability that is crucial for (remote) collaboration. Here, users can explore the same visualization via our collaboratively usable desktop, virtual reality, and also augmented reality modes. Our prototype follows the Twelve-Factor App methodology to build a cloud-native application that comprises multiple scalable microservices. Thanks to horizontal scaling, our implementation is capable to analyze a large amount of visualization data; thus, allowing multiple users to simultaneously use the software visualization service. We conducted a set of preliminary performance exper-iments to benchmark our prototype's scalability. Results show that the evaluated service scales linearly with increasing load.",
            "TLDR": "The conceptual design and a prototype implementation of an online available software-as-a-service application that analyzes, persists, and visualizes software applications which users intend to explore and comprehend via software visualization are presented."

            "Abstract": "Accurate prediction of future incoming workloads to cloud applications, such as future user request count, is critical to proactive auto-scaling, and in general, critical to the cost-effectiveness of cloud deployments. However, designing a generic predictive framework that can accurately predict for any types of workloads is difficult, especially when the workload is dynamic and can change to a pattern that has not been observed in the training data sets. However, existing workload prediction solutions typically rely on complex machine learning models, which require comprehensive training data, making it difficult for them to handle dynamic workloads. Moreover, the training of existing workload prediction solutions are also expensive in terms of both time and computing resources. This paper presents a generic and low-cost online workload prediction framework, called Cloud Bruno, which combines the more accurate LSTM models with less expensive but fast SVM models to achieve high accuracy and low training overhead. When compared to existing predictors, CloudBruno had at least 8.8 % lower error than existing deep learning-based predictors for a highly-dynamic workload that does not have comprehensive training data (i.e, has changes unknown to training data). For workloads with comprehensive training data, Cloud Bruno's error was at most 2.5 % higher than optimized deep learning-based predictors. More importantly, Cloud Bruno can effectively execute on a free cloud CPU, allowing it to be used as an online workload predictor without additional cost.",

            "Abstract": "The data explosion over the past few years has made it necessary to connect edge networks to the more powerful cloud infrastructure. Given the heterogeneity, dis-aggregation, and varied functionalities of the edge, it makes it more challenging to monitor and manage the edge using a single control plane. This is especially relevant to Edge Enterprise Network, which spans across Edge Access Networks, Wireless Access Networks, Sensor networks etc. This data explosion at the edge has also necessitated the edge Enterprise Network to support varied functionality, causing it to comprise of multiple modules to provide best performance. This renders the edge-Network cumbersome to manage and very susceptible to faults. Consequently, the highly increasing need to embrace cloud-native technology for Edge computation has become significant for service and application providers to deploy high computation functionalities closer to end users. This motivates us to build an intelligent framework to maintain and manage Edge Enterprise Networks. In this paper, we present ‚ÄúUnifiedNetManagement‚Äù, our Hybrid Cloud solution, that integrates any edge network to the cloud using an event-driven Workflow Manager to provide monitoring, scheduling, and troubleshooting capabilities for a smart edge network management system. We observe close to 2x performance improvement over traditional disaggregated network management.",

The problem of optimum virtual machine placement as needed in the network operator context is detailed, and different solving strategies are proposed and discussed, including heuristics based on genetic optimization. Also, experimental results are presented that compare these strategies with one another from the standpoint of optimality and execution times, using a data-set made of some of the real problems that had to be solved in the past few years by Vodafone, in order to optimize its capacity planning decisions. The presented experimental results highlight that an optimum solver leads to excessively high computation times for large problems, whereas simple heuristics may exhibit significant loss in optimality at reduced computation times. Genetic optimization, on the other hand, constitutes a very interesting trade-off between these two extremes. The data-set used for the provided results is published under an open data license, for possible reuse in future research works on the topic.",

            "Abstract": "In edge and cloud environments, using graphics processing units (GPUs) as a high-speed parallel computing device increases the performance of compute-intensive applications. Nowadays, due to the increase in the volume and complexity of data to be processed, GPUs are more actively used in component-based applications. As a result, the sequence of multiple interdependent components is co-located on the GPU and shares GPU resources. The overall application performance in this kind of application depends on the data transfer overhead and the performance of each component in the sequence. Managing the components' competitive use of shared GPU resources faces various challenges. The lack of a low-overhead and online technique for dynamic GPU resource allocation leads to imbalanced GPU usage and penalizes the overall performance. In this paper, we present efficient GPU memory and resource managers that improve overall system performance by using shared memory and dynamically assigning portions of shared GPU resources. The portions are based on the components' workload and throughput-based performance analyzer while guaranteeing the application's progress. The evaluation results show that our dynamic resource allocation method is able to improve the average performance of the applications with the various number of concurrent components by up to 29.81% over the default GPU concurrent multitasking. We also show that using shared memory results in 2x performance improvements.",
            "TLDR": "This paper presents efficient GPU memory and resource managers that improve overall system performance by using shared memory and dynamically assigning portions of shared GPU resources that are based on the components' workload and throughput-based performance analyzer while guaranteeing the application's progress."

            "Abstract": "Virtual machine (VM) based application sandboxes leverage strong isolation guarantees of virtualization techniques to address several security issues through effective containment of malware. Specifically, in end-user physical hosts, potentially vulnerable applications can be isolated from each other (and the host) using VM based sandboxes. However, sharing data across applications executing within different sandboxes is a non-trivial requirement for end-user systems because at the end of the day, all applications are used by the end-user owning the device. Existing file sharing techniques compromise the security or efficiency, especially considering lack of technical expertise of many end-users in the contemporary times. In this paper, we propose MicroBlind, a security hardened file sharing framework for virtualized sandboxes to support efficient data sharing across different application sandboxes. MicroBlind enables a simple file sharing management API for end users where the end user can orchestrate file sharing across different VM sandboxes in a secure manner. To demonstrate the efficacy of MicroBlind, we perform comprehensive empirical analysis against existing data sharing techniques (augmented for the sandboxing setup) and show that MicroBlind provides improved security and efficiency.",
            "TLDR": "The proposed MicroBlind enables a simple file sharing management API for end users where the end user can orchestrate file sharing across different VM sandboxes in a secure manner and provides improved security and efficiency."

            "Abstract": "Although machine learning (ML)-based models are increasingly being used by cloud-based data-driven services, two key problems exist when used at the edge. First, the size and complexity of these models hampers their deployment at the edge, where heterogeneity of resource types and constraints on resources is the norm. Second, ML models are known to be vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. To address the edge deployment issue, model compression techniques, especially model quantization, have shown significant promise. However, the adversarial robustness of such quantized models remains mostly an open problem. To address this challenge, this paper investigates whether quantized models with different precision levels can be vulnerable to the same universal adversarial perturbation (UAP). Based on these insights, the paper then presents a cloud-native service that generates and distributes adversarially robust compressed models deployable at the edge using a novel, defensive post-training quantization approach. Experimental evaluations reveal that although quantized models are vulnerable to UAPs, post-training quantization on the synthesized, adversarially-trained models are effective against such UAPs. Furthermore, deployments on heterogeneous edge devices with flexible quantization settings are efficient thereby paving the way in realizing adversarially robust data-driven cloud/edge services.",

Although previous intrusion detection systems can detect security attacks, understanding the underlying software defects that cause those security vulnerabilities is little studied. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study over 110 software security vulnera-bilities in 13 popular cloud server systems. To understand the underlying vulnerabilities, we answer the following questions: 1) what are the root causes of those security vulnerabilities? 2) what threat impact do those vulnerable code have? 3) how do developers patch those vulnerable code? Our results show that the vulnerable code of the studied security vulnerabilities comprise five common categories: 1) improper execution restrictions, 2) improper permission checks, 3) improper resource path-name checks, 4) improper sensitive data handling, and 5) improper synchronization handling. We further extract principal vulnerable code patterns from those common vulnerability categories.",

This makes timely identification of the root causes for faults that occur in such systems an important-yet-challenging task. In this paper, we propose a solution that automatically builds a correlation model and an anomaly detection model using kernel traces of cloud servers. The correlation model is used to capture the dependencies between the various elements of the cloud system while the anomaly detection model is used to identify anomalies related to specific elements of the system. Upon detection of a fault, our framework computes a dependency graph of detected anomalies using the models, which in turn is used to perform the root cause analysis. Evaluation results of our proposed framework on a Kubernetes cloud show that it can effectively find root causes of injected faults with an accuracy rate between 80% and 99.3%, with a low false negative rate.",

            "Abstract": "The security of container-based microservices relies heavily on the isolation of operating system resources that is provided by namespaces. However, vulnerabilities exist in the isolation of containers that may be exploited by attackers to gain access to the host. These are commonly referred to as container escape attacks. While prior work has identified vulnerabilities in namespace isolation, no general container escape detection and warning system has been presented. We present Paced, a novel, realtime system to detect container-escape attacks. We define what constitutes a cross-namespace event and how such events can be used to detect a container escape attack. We develop a provenance-based approach to isolate cross-namespace events and propose a rule‚Äîprivileged_flow‚Äîto detect attacks on Docker and Kubernetes environments. We evaluate our detection method on a suite of contemporary CVEs with container escape exploits, bad container configurations, and benchmarks. Paced achieves near-perfect accuracy with no false negatives. We release our implementation and datasets as free, open-source software.",

            "Abstract": "Containers are the technology for Linux to isolate execution environments. By distributing a container image, which is a collection of files contained in the container, users can use an execution environment that includes the necessary files and libraries. However, container images are tens to hundreds of megabytes in size and require many network resources to be transferred. Especially in low-bandwidth network environments like edge computing, frequent image updating can be difficult and affect other services‚Äô communication. In this paper, we propose a method to reduce the data size required for image updates using delta encoding. We use delta encoding to reduce data size and finish updating quickly, but generating and applying deltas is a time-consuming operation. Our method proposes DeltaMerging which enables faster delta generation by merging existing deltas, and Di3FS which applies deltas lazily. The proposed method reduces the data size required to update container images from 5 to 40% of that of existing methods. Also, the time required to generate and apply deltas is greatly reduced with DeltaMerging and Di3FS. Furthermore, the performance degradation of the application in the container was almost negligible.",

            "Abstract": "In systems designed based on microservice architecture, many production-like environments should be deployed for testing, staging, debugging, and previewing. One way to reduce resource consumption while deploying many environments is to allow sharing of common microservices in multiple environments, and current mechanisms extend application layer protocols like HTTP and gRPC to propagate contexts including environment identifiers and to route requests. However, microservices also use other protocols such as MySQL, Redis, Memcached, and AMQP, and extending each protocol requires lots of effort to implement the extensions. This paper proposes PiCoP, a framework to propagate contexts and route requests independently of application layer protocols. PiCoP consists of a protocol that propagates contexts without interpreting application layer protocols by adding contexts to the front of each TCP byte stream and a proxy that uses the protocol to route requests. We design the protocol to make instrumentation into a system as easy as possible. We showed that PiCoP could reduce resource usage, that the proxy's communication delay is within a practical range, and that it makes sharing microservices in multiple environments with any application layer protocols possible.",

            "Abstract": "Due to the ever-growing demand for computational resources, the environmental impact of data centers is continuously increasing. Recently, a great effort has been made to mitigate this impact, while the demand for computational resources has continued to grow. Current mitigation strategies focus on the infrastructure perspective, while the application perspective has been neglected. This paper aims to engage application designers and developers on the path to greener application design. Following the Sustainable Application Design Process (SADP) methodology, we introduce a Sustainable Application Design Architecture (SADA) for enriching cloud-native application components with sustainability features that can be exploited to adapt the application workflow to the environmental context. The architecture enables synergies from design to deployment between all stakeholders involved in the application management. The paper focuses on enriching the application with sustainability features in the design and development phases. We also present and discuss a prototype that can translate design-level sustainability features into development features.",
            "TLDR": "A Sustainable Application Design Architecture (SADA) for enriching cloud-native application components with sustainability features that can be exploited to adapt the application workflow to the environmental context is introduced."

            "Abstract": "Microservice-based architectures consist of numerous, loosely coupled services with multiple instances. Service meshes aim to simplify traffic management and prevent microservice overload through circuit breaking and request retry mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that the static configuration of these mechanisms is unfit for the dynamic environment of microservices. We conduct a sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of retrying across a wide range of scenarios. Based on the findings, we propose a retry controller that can also work with dynamically configured circuit breakers. We have empirically assessed our proposed controller in various scenarios, including transient overload and noisy neighbors while enforcing adaptive circuit breaking. The results show that our proposed controller does not deviate from a well-tuned configuration while maintaining carried response time and adapting to the changes. In comparison to the default static retry configuration that is mostly used in practice, our approach improves the carried throughput up to 12x and 32x respectively in the cases of transient overload and noisy neighbors.",
            "TLDR": "The results show that the proposed controller does not deviate from a well-tuned configuration while maintaining carried response time and adapting to the changes, and improves the carried throughput up to 12x and 32x respectively in the cases of transient overload and noisy neighbors."

            "Abstract": "Cloud services have been well integrated into various sectors of contemporary societies such as transportation, healthcare, and work. However, the energy sector has made little progress in offering cloud services to energy consumers. In some cases, even basic features (such as energy consumption monitoring and visualization of households) are still unattainable. To foster innovation in cloud-based energy services, governments implement regulations that moderate access to energy data via the energy providers‚Äô platforms. Despite these regulations, cloud service providers may still struggle to aggregate energy data because each energy provider may be using different procedures, authentication mechanisms, and data semantics. Consequently, aggregating energy data at scale becomes challenging, as it requires achieving compatibility with diverse platforms. To address this challenge, we propose a cloud-based framework that handles all interactions with energy providers and prepares the data for further processing by services. Additionally, we analyze the socioeconomic impact of our approach, and we outline novel use cases that may emerge due to the proposed framework.",
            "TLDR": "This work proposes a cloud-based framework that handles all interactions with energy providers and prepares the data for further processing by services, and outlines novel use cases that may emerge due to the proposed framework."

            "Abstract": "A new frontier in Smart Agriculture is merging nanobiotechnology with edge computing, for on-field raw data collection and processing. Smart plant sensors communicate plant chemical signals to on-field agricultural and phenotyping equipment. Particularly promising are the Organic Electro-chemical Transistors (OECTs), i.e., devices that can measure the ionic content of liquid samples and biological systems. In this work, we present and evaluate several algorithms for solving a mathematical model that describes the behavior of OECT devices, in order to translate raw values like electrical currents, to meaningful information about the monitored plant stem, e.g., the concentration of ions and water saturation. Our Rust-based algorithm implementations are energy-efficient and suitable for real-time execution on constrained edge devices, as we demonstrate providing several experimental results that concern the quality of model solution, memory footprint, execution time, and the energy cost. The experiments were carried out using two different Arm Cortex-M processors, an ultra low power one and a high performance one.",

            "Abstract": "The high demand for energy consumption and the resulting carbon footprint of the cloud pose significant sustainability challenges, as cloud data centers consume vast amounts of energy. The emergence of serverless cloud computing platforms has opened up new avenues for more sustainable cloud computing. Serverless Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) cloud computing platforms facilitate deploying applications as decoupled microservices to leverage automatic rapid scaling, high availability, fault tolerance, and on-demand pricing. The absence of always-on hosting costs associated with virtual machines enables serverless functions to be deployed with many different function configurations and cloud regions to achieve high performance, low network latency, and reduced costs. In this paper, we investigate the utility of a global sky computing platform where serverless resources are aggregated between up to 19 distinct cloud regions. We prototype a serverless load distribution system to distribute client requests across serverless aggregations to minimize performance objectives, including network latency, runtime, hosting costs, and carbon footprint. To evaluate our serverless distribution system's ability to meet performance objectives, we continuously executed large experiments across 19 regions around the world from November 2022 through March 2023. Our serverless load distribution approach using aggregated resources reduced the carbon intensity of a globally distributed serverless application by up to 99.8%, network latency by 65%, or hosting costs by 58% by optimizing function routing to deployments with optimal hardware configurations.",
            "TLDR": "The utility of a global sky computing platform where serverless resources are aggregated between up to 19 distinct cloud regions is investigated and a serverless load distribution system to distribute client requests across serverless aggregations to minimize performance objectives is prototype."

            "Abstract": "In this paper, we propose GreenCoin ‚Äì an energy-efficient cryptocurrency system with mining protocols designed to favor locations with relatively higher availability of renewable energy. Traditionally, crypto coin mining involves solving complex mathematical problems by high-end computing devices consuming an enormous amount of electricity, thus adversely affecting net carbon emissions. To reduce cost and emissions, GreenCoin uses a modified proof of stake (PoS) consensus algorithm, which itself is more energy efficient compared to other state-of-the-art methods. Our modified PoS algorithm, called Green PoS (GPoS), allows GreenCoin to favor nodes (with reward and privilege) located in regions with higher availability of renewable energy. We present a detailed system architecture of GreenCoin and explain the operating method of GPoS. We also provide results from empirical studies demonstrating the renewable energy-aware approach of GreenCoin.",
            "TLDR": "This paper presents a detailed system architecture of GreenCoin, a energy-efficient cryptocurrency system with mining protocols designed to favor locations with relatively higher availability of renewable energy, and explains the operating method of GPoS, the modified proof of stake consensus algorithm."

            "Abstract": "Cloud infrastructures are large-scale and complex platforms designed to host a wide diversity of applications and workloads. Given these complexity and scale factors, simulators and benchmarks are broadly adopted in vitro to study their behaviors, prototype new software components and heuristics, and evaluate their effective performances.However, both state-of-the-art simulations and benchmarks may suffer from a representativeness problem, as the reported results can vary depending on their input workloads. For example, a Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) platform aims to host Virtual Machines (VMs), whose characteristics (resource configurations, workload intensity, arrival/departure rate, etc.) can greatly differ depending on Cloud providers and public/private deployments. Addressing this IaaS representativeness thus requires Cloud providers to share production-scale datasets, which might be considered sensitive. Moreover, Simulations and benchmarks require a specific experiment scenario that cannot be easily generated from Cloud providers characteristics.To address these issues, this paper introduces CloudFactory, a IaaS workload generator. Our contribution is first composed of a library that can be used by Cloud providers to share IaaS statistics, instead of raw datasets. Then, we introduce a generator designed to produce realistic VM workloads that match these statistics. CloudFactory is made available as open-source software that can be adopted by Cloud providers and researchers to foster the evaluation of new contributions.As an example, we perform an analysis on scheduling evolution for different IaaS workload intensity of two different Cloud providers: Microsoft Azure and Chameleon. We also report on OVHcloud statistics computed from CloudFactory and compare them to other Cloud providers.",

            "Abstract": "Fog data processing systems provide key abstractions to manage data and event processing in the geo-distributed and heterogeneous fog environment. The lack of standardized benchmarks for such systems, however, hinders their development and deployment, as different approaches cannot be compared quantitatively. Existing cloud data benchmarks are inadequate for fog computing, as their focus on workload specification ignores the tight integration of application and infrastructure inherent in fog computing.In this paper, we outline an approach to a fog-native data processing benchmark that combines workload specifications with infrastructure specifications. This holistic approach allows researchers and engineers to quantify how a software approach performs for a given workload on given infrastructure. Further, by basing our benchmark in a realistic IoT sensor network scenario, we can combine paradigms such as low-latency event processing, machine learning inference, and offline data analytics, and analyze the performance impact of their interplay in a fog data processing system.",
            "TLDR": "This paper outlines an approach to a fog-native data processing benchmark that combines workload specifications with infrastructure specifications, and can combine paradigms such as low-latency event processing, machine learning inference, and offline data analytics, and analyze the performance impact in a fog data processing system."

Among them are the data stream processing systems that are deployed in cloud data centers by companies, such as Twitter, to process billion of events per day in real time. However, studying the energy consumption of such infrastructures is difficult because they rely on a complex virtualized software ecosystem where attributing energy consumption to individual software components is a challenge, and because the space of possible configurations is large. We present GreenFlow, a principled methodology and tool designed to automate the deployment of energy measurement experiments for data stream processing systems in cloud environments. GreenFlow is designed to deliver reproducible results while remaining flexible enough to support a wide range of experiments. We illustrate its usage and show in particular that consolidating a DSP system in the smallest number of servers that are capable of processing it is an effective way to reduce energy consumption.",

Contrary to traditional relational databases, NoSQL architectures are capable of ingesting the ever-growing volume of nowadays‚Äô data-driven applications characterized by low-latency and high-throughput requirements. However, it is difficult to build an ultra-scalable, high-performance storage engine that can sustain an arbitrary number of concurrent clients. A common technique to increase throughput is minimizing the OS overhead, quantified as the number of context switches, through busy waiting (or \"spinning\"). While this simple synchronization mechanism proves to be beneficial in the high-performance computing community, it requires special care to avoid wasting resources and counter-intuitive behaviors. In this paper, we address an instance of \"unsafe\" busy waiting in WiredTiger, the underlying storage engine of MongoDB, which leads to a consistent, excessive increase of tail latency in high contention scenarios.",

            "Abstract": "Efficiently allocating incoming jobs to nodes in large-scale clusters can lead to substantial improvements in both cluster utilization and job performance. In order to allocate incoming jobs, cluster schedulers usually rely on a set of scoring functions to rank feasible nodes. Results from individual scoring functions are usually weighted equally, which could lead to suboptimal deployments as the one-size-fits-all solution does not take into account the characteristics of each workload. Tuning the weights of scoring functions, however, requires expert knowledge and is computationally expensive.This paper proposes a reinforcement learning approach for learning the weights in scheduler scoring algorithms with the overall objective of improving the end-to-end performance of jobs for a given cluster. Our approach is based on percentage improvement reward, frame-stacking, and limiting domain information. We propose a percentage improvement reward to address the objective of multi-step parameter tuning. The inclusion of frame-stacking allows for carrying information across an optimization experiment. Limiting domain information prevents overfitting and improves performance in unseen clusters and workloads. The policy is trained on different combinations of workloads and cluster setups. We demonstrate the proposed approach improves performance on average by 33% compared to fixed weights and 12% compared to the best-performing baseline in a lab-based serverless scenario.",

            "Abstract": "As Exascale computing becomes a reality, the energy needs of compute nodes in cloud data centers will continue to grow. A common approach to reducing this energy demand is to limit the power consumption of hardware components when workloads are experiencing bottlenecks elsewhere in the system. However, designing a resource controller capable of detecting and limiting power consumption on-the-fly is a complex issue and can also adversely impact application performance. In this paper, we explore the use of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to design a power capping policy on cloud compute nodes using observations on current power consumption and instantaneous application performance (heartbeats). By leveraging the Argo Node Resource Management (NRM) software stack in conjunction with the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL) hardware control mechanism, we design an agent to control the maximum supplied power to processors without compromising on application performance. Employing a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent to learn an optimal policy on a mathematical model of the compute nodes, we demonstrate and evaluate using the STREAM benchmark how a trained agent running on actual hardware can take actions by balancing power consumption and application performance.",

            "Abstract": "Nowadays, machine learning has become an indispensable service for cloud providers. Elastic training, a novel training paradigm that dynamically adjusts resource allocation for a group of training jobs, has gained popularity due to its ability to effectively utilize accelerators, which are essential for training a massive number of deep learning models. Despite the existence of numerous scheduling algorithms for elastic training, most lack an easy-to-use yet efficient platform to execute them. In this paper, we present Voda, a GPU scheduling platform for elastic deep learning. In contrast to prior approaches that employ parameter servers for elastic training, Voda is designed for AllReduce-style communication, which proves to be more effective, albeit more complex to adjust. Voda, built on top of Kubernetes, consists of a set of loosely coupled components that collect runtime information, dynamically alter the resource allocation, and optimize job placement based on communication costs among underlying GPUs. We implement and compare four scheduling algorithms for elastic training, including three existing methods and one newly proposed, on Voda, with different workloads, job distributions, and arrival patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that no single algorithm dominates all performance metrics, such as average job completion time, running time, or makespan. However, certain algorithms outperform others under specific workloads and job distributions. Additionally, our experiments highlight the significance of job placement in GPU clusters, and our proposed method effectively optimizes communication costs among different workers of a job.",

            "Abstract": "The increasing demand for computational power in big data and machine learning has driven the development of distributed training methodologies. Among these, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks provide advantages such as enhanced scalability and fault tolerance. However, they also encounter challenges related to resource consumption, costs, and communication overhead as the number of participating peers grows. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture that combines serverless computing with P2P networks for distributed training and present a method for efficient parallel gradient computation under resource constraints.Our findings show a significant enhancement in gradient computation time, with up to a 97.34% improvement compared to conventional P2P distributed training methods. As for costs, our examination confirmed that the serverless architecture could incur higher expenses, reaching up to 5.4 times more than instance-based architectures. It is essential to consider that these higher costs are associated with marked improvements in computation time, particularly under resource-constrained scenarios.Despite the cost-time trade-off, the serverless approach still holds promise due to its pay-as-you-go model. Utilizing dynamic resource allocation, it enables faster training times and optimized resource utilization, making it a promising candidate for a wide range of machine learning applications.",

            "Abstract": "The edge to data center computing continuum is the aggregation of computing resources located anywhere between the network edge (e.g. close to 5G antennas), and servers in traditional data centers. Kubernetes is the de facto standard for container orchestration. It is very efficient in a data center environment, but it fails to give the same performance when adding edge resources. At the edge, resources are more limited, and networking conditions are changing over time.In this paper, we present a methodology that lowers the costs of running applications in the edge-to-cloud computing continuum. A cost-aware scheduler enables this optimization. We are also monitoring the Key Performance Indicators of the applications to ensure that cost optimizations do not impact negatively their Quality of Service. In addition, to ensure that performances are optimal even when users are moving, we introduce a background process that periodically checks if a better location is available for the application. To demonstrate the performance of our scheduling approach, we evaluate it on a vehicle cooperative perception use case, a representative 5G application.",

            "Abstract": "The amalgamation of multiple Edge and Cloud clusters into an Edge-Cloud continuum requires efficient scheduling techniques to cope with high numbers of infrastructure nodes and computing jobs. Since monolithic schedulers typically do not scale well beyond a certain cluster size, distributed scheduling approaches are usually employed to address such scalability issues. Distributed schedulers are often designed for Cloud environments and lack support for the Edge. Conversely, many Edge schedulers focus on single clusters and provide limited support to deal with the scale of the Edge-Cloud continuum. In this paper, we present the Vela Distributed Scheduler, a globally distributed scheduler, which is specifically tailored for the Edge-Cloud continuum. The main contributions of our work include: i) A novel, globally distributed and orchestrator-independent scheduler with a 3-phase scheduling workflow; ii) A two-level, informed sampling mechanism, which reduces latency for globally distributed sampling and leverages job requirements to produce high quality node samples; And iii) a MultiBind mechanism that significantly reduces job evictions and rescheduling due to scheduling conflicts. We implement Vela on top of Kubernetes and evaluate it in a realistic large-scale setup using multiple interconnected, globally distributed, and production-ready MicroK8s clusters with up to 20,000 total simulated nodes. Our results show that Vela‚Äôs performance scales linearly with infrastructure size and that it reduces scheduling conflicts by a factor of 10.",

            "Abstract": "Many complex workflows consist of multiple tasks represented as a directed acyclic graph (DAG). Optimal deployment of such workflows on a cloud using multiple services requires a judicious selection of compute and storage services to minimize the makespan and the cost of deployment. Multi-cloud deployment is emerging as a preferred choice for the deployment of complex workflows for price competitiveness and freedom from vendor lock-in. However, finding an optimal mapping scheme for heterogeneous tasks of a workflow in a multi-cloud environment is a challenge. Furthermore, each participating cloud service provider (CSP) has a unique cost model and maximum deliverable performance. This makes exploration of the optimal configuration of the chosen service daunting. Many algorithms, frameworks, and tools have been proposed to schedule complex workflows on cloud using virtual machines (VMs) available as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). However, the use of scalable and cost-effective serverless platforms offered as Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) is still in its infancy.In this work, we use particle swarm optimization (PSO) for mapping complex workflows to cloud services such as computing, and storage in a multi-cloud scenario. We map complex workflows to the serverless platforms and storage services from popular cloud vendors namely Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure (AZR), and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The experimental evaluation shows that our approach results in up to 61% improvement in makespan and 51% improvement in the cost of workflow deployment as compared to naive and intuition-based mapping in a cloud.",

In the context of monitoring cloud infrastructure and services, surfacing the right set of alerts to human operators is critical to ensure timely intervention for issues that may otherwise result in significant impact to customers as well as for avoiding operator burnout.To assess alert quality we focus on the notion of actionable alerts ‚Äì a specific alert is categorized as actionable or not based on historic evidence of operator actions having been taken in response to such alerts. Using alert data collected over a six month period from a combination of cloud environments that include pre-production and production systems, alerts are categorized as true positive, false positive or false negative with respect to their actionability. Based on this, we then introduce and quantify precision and miss rates per alert category (trigger condition) from the historic data. Noisy, non-actionable alerts are identified using precision. Gaps in coverage are identified using miss rate, or failure of monitoring to detect issues.A prescriptive approach is then provided to increase the alerts‚Äô value that includes refinement of alert definitions, replacement of alerts that are no longer actionable and identification of alerting coverage gaps. We monitored our REFORM system over three months and found that the volume of noisy, non-actionable alerts were significantly reduced and furthermore, this resulted in significantly higher intervention rates from the operators.",

            "Abstract": "The increasing popularity of cloud-based platforms has led to the emergence of two prominent open-source solutions: OpenStack and Kubernetes. OpenStack facilitates computing and networking resources through virtual machine instances, while Kubernetes excels in container orchestration, managing containerized workloads and services. This paper explores the implementation of Service Function Chaining (SFC) using a combination of virtual machines in OpenStack and containers in Kubernetes. The primary focus of our study is to analyze the performance of containers within the context of chain deployment in Kubernetes. Our experimentation reveals compelling insights into container bootup times, showcasing their efficiency when compared to virtual machines. Additionally, we meticulously evaluate the impact of integrating SFC-related interfaces into pods forming a chain, particularly assessing CPU, memory, and bandwidth utilization. Our findings underline the advantages of utilizing containers in SFC deployment scenarios and shed light on the potential overhead that arises during interface integration.",

            "Abstract": "Stream processing has become a critical component in the architecture of modern applications. With the exponential growth of data generation from sources such as the Internet of Things, business intelligence, and telecommunications, real-time processing of unbounded data streams has become a necessity. DSP systems provide a solution to this challenge, offering high horizontal scalability, fault-tolerant execution, and the ability to process data streams from multiple sources in a single DSP job. Often enough though, data streams need to be enriched with extra information for correct processing, which introduces additional dependencies and potential bottlenecks.In this paper, we present an in-depth evaluation of data enrichment methods for DSP systems and identify the different use cases for stream processing in modern systems. Using a representative DSP system and conducting the evaluation in a realistic cloud environment, we found that outsourcing enrichment data to the DSP system can improve performance for specific use cases. However, this increased resource consumption highlights the need for stream processing solutions specifically designed for the performance-intensive workloads of cloud-based applications.",
            "TLDR": "It is found that outsourcing enrichment data to the DSP system can improve performance for specific use cases, and the need for stream processing solutions specifically designed for the performance-intensive workloads of cloud-based applications is highlighted."

            "Abstract": "Cities worldwide are trying to increase the modal share of bicycle traffic to address traffic and carbon emission problems. Aside from safety, a key factor for this is the cycling comfort, including the surface quality of cycle paths. In this paper, we propose a novel edge-based crowdsensing method for analyzing the surface quality of bicycle paths using smartphone sensor data: Cyclists record their rides which after preprocessed on their phones before being uploaded to a private cloud backend. There, additional analysis modules aggregate data from all available rides to derive surface quality information which can then used for surface quality-aware routing and planning of infrastructure maintenance.",
